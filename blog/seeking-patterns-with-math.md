Is math important to you? Is it because you make use of basic math facts in your daily life, such as when you go shopping or [walking down the street](https://nrich.maths.org/5546)? Sure, but some people use it for technical work in fields such as finance, engineering, chemistry and architecture, just to name a few. Pretty much every field has some math applications. Math can be an incredibly useful tool. Is it a mistake, however, for us to think of math as only being a tool? We believe it is so much more. 

In fact, math can be studied for its own sake. As [Arthur Benjamin](https://www.math.hmc.edu/~benjamin/), author of [The Magic of Math: Solving for x and Figuring Out Why](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Math-Solving-Figuring-Out/dp/0465054722/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8), beautifully says, “*Math is the science of finding patterns.*” Those patterns could involve anything from numeric sequences to geometric relationships. For example, **modular arithmetic**, first developed by [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss), is a type of arithmetic done on a **number circle** rather than a **number line**. Numbers reset to $0$ upon reaching a certain fixed number. The classic example is arithmetic on a clock: when we get to $12$, the count resets to $0$. So, for example, on a clock, $10$ o’clock plus $4$ o’clock equals $2$ o’clock. This is mod $12$ arithmetic.

While modular arithmetic does have some wonderful properties, one of its major practical uses only came about in the 1970s when mathematicians used it in developing [RSA encryption](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_algorithm) -- a method used to send and receive secure data like [private love letters](http://theconversation.com/the-rsa-algorithm-or-how-to-send-private-love-letters-13191).

In a short ten minute [Numberphile](https://www.numberphile.com/) video [James Grime](http://singingbanana.com/) wonderfully explains how the RSA key works:

If math is the science of finding patterns, then how do we actually find them? Well, there may be many avenues; here, let’s consider two popular themes:

1) **Induction**: we find a new or a unique rule that helps explain the pattern.

2) **Deduction**: we use other existing patterns to help uncover the new pattern.

In this blog, we will use the deductive method to help us solve the following puzzle:

In the above diagram, we have two primary shapes: a quarter circle with a radius, $r$, of length $6$ inches, and a rectangle inscribed inside the quarter circle whose side lengths of $x$ and $y$ add up to $8$ inches. The problem is to find the area of the white triangle.

To solve this problem, we can use our existing knowledge of these shapes (hint: deduction). Observe that the area of the white triangle is half the area of the rectangle with sides of length $x$ and $y$ as in the picture.
