At One on Epsilon we value joyful, global mathematics. We love exploration, creativity, and curiosity. Our [diverse team](https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream/#content-team) of educators thrives on mathematics, and we believe that everyone and anyone can build a mathematical mindset. It is rewarding and fun!

With that goal, as we continue to improve our free Epsilon Stream platform, we engage with dozens of mathematics videos per week. Through this process, thousands of great videos have already been included in the [Epsilon Stream](https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream/) experience. A select few of these videos are mind-blowing, jaw-dropping and enlightening. These are the videos that make it to our monthly [Editors' Picks](https://epsilonstream.com/topic/editorspicks/).

We are now celebrating a year of Editors' Picks. This is a collection of videos that our team loved watching. These mathematics videos are typically not meant to prepare you for a specific school assessment task or study goal. They are simply pure, joyful entertainment. Don't get us wrong, this is mathematics, with plenty of thought provoking content. So engage and think as you watch this mind blowing, joyful, and charming mathematics.
