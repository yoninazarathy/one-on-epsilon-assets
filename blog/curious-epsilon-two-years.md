We started creating our mathematical blog posts two years ago and we continue up to this day with the overarching theme of Nurturing Mathematical Curiosity. A few months ago we separated our weekly blog posts into the main series [Curious Epsilon](https://epsilonstream.com/topic/oneonepsilonblog), [Editors' Picks](https://epsilonstream.com/topic/awesomevideos) and [One on Epsilon News](https://epsilonstream.com/topic/oneonepsilonnews). These are all accessible from our [landing page](https://oneonepsilon.com) or from [Epsilon Stream](https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream) and updates are sent to those who are [registered](https://oneonepsilon.com/register/) with us.  

So what will you find in the Curious Epsilon series?

There are currently 45 Curious Epsilon blog posts dealing with a variety of subjects ranging from geometry to imaginary numbers.  They are written by our content team including school teachers **Coco** and **Yousuf**; curriculum developer **Clara**; research mathematicians **Inna**, **Phil** and **Yoni**; and data science experts **Aapeli** and **Nick**. As parents, teachers and mathematicians we aim to keep a light tone while focusing on mathematical accuracy. 

When we create a blog post, the main author(s) receives feedback from the rest of the team. We love the collaboration and love learning from one another. Our blog post creation process also parallels our main content activity: curation for [Epsilon Stream](https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream). This free platform aims to answer anything in primary, secondary and exploratory mathematics by delivering a concise hand picked collection of content selected by our team. Search for anything in Epsilon Stream and you'll get descriptions, YouTube videos and our [Curious Epsilon](https://epsilonstream.com/topic/oneonepsilonblog) blog posts.
