**How to Trisect an Angle with Origami** by [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile): We have previously featured Dr. Zsuzsanna Dancso where she showed us how to dissect an angle using a compass in [Euclid's Big Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lm9EHhbJAY&list=PLt5AfwLFPxWLGm-EZUKAdx7wad6mjCQsh&index=2). This month, we are featuring her again trisecting an angle using origami. For more fun, perhaps get a piece of paper out, follow Dr. Dansco's approach and even challenge yourself with a proof of why this folding works.
