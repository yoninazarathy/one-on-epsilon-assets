**One on Epsilon Team**

A key goal of Epsilon Stream is to present you with useful videos for pre-university mathematics. You can ask Epsilon Stream about "addition of fractions", "parabola", "zero to the power zero" or thousands of other search terms.  Epsilon Stream then responds with a succinct short list of useful youtube videos, written content and games. 

 

Search in Epsilon Stream and get a short list of results as
selected by our professional content team.

 

Our philosophy is that for a specific subject such as mathematics, experts curating, selecting and reviewing can do better than any automatic system built to date. We thrive on the fact that there are incredible mathematics channels on youtube. We select from thousands of videos and resources, to give you a handful of results per search subject. Indeed, our content team is continuously improving and refining this search experience. For you. Free.

However, Epsilon Stream isn't just for practical search, it is also a place to enjoy curiosity driven exploration. Our content team thrives on exploring and analysing creative youtube videos, great maths education games and wonderful blog posts. These are then presented in Epsilon Stream's home under "Editor's Picks".
