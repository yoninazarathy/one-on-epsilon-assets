# The Spirit of Global Math Week

**One on Epsilon Team**

[Global Math Week](https://www.globalmathproject.org/learn/) 2018 has just finished. It was a spectacular celebration of joyful global mathematics, experienced by millions of students and tens of thousands of educators across the globe. The theme was [Exploding Dots](https://epsilonstream.com/topic/explodingdots/). A visually engaging system for numbers, arithmetic, polynomials and much more. Why global? Why celebrate? Why math?

As recently stated by [Keith Devlin](http://devlinsangle.blogspot.com/2018/05/calculation-was-price-we-used-to-have.html): **Calculation was the price we used to have to pay to do mathematics.**

What does that actually mean? You may be thinking... "mathematics is calculation, is it not?".

One approach is to think of "mathematics as a high dimensional solid with many facets. Then "calculation" is only one such facet, and there are many more! Read [Devlin's post](http://devlinsangle.blogspot.com/2018/05/calculation-was-price-we-used-to-have.html) for a great perspective and reflect on your relationship with mathematics.

So how does the Global Math Project fit in?

Via exploding dots: numbers, arithmetic, and polynomials are explored under a new light; helping clarify, deepen and even further extend the typical methods explored in traditional schools. The aim is to explore the emerging relationships. The calculation is a by-product; it isn't a goal. A goal is the mathematical joy. The Global Math Week did just that. Globally!

At One on Epsilon, the Global Math Week and [James Tanton's exploding dots](http://gdaymath.com/courses/exploding-dots/) align perfectly with our [philosophy and values](https://oneonepsilon.com/about-us/). Our aim is delivering products that help students, parents and educators with their current studies while facilitating mathematical exploration. This is why we integrated exploding dots into [Epsilon Stream](https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream/).

Users search Epsilon Stream for items such as [place value](https://epsilonstream.com/topic/placevalue/), [number bases](https://epsilonstream.com/topic/baserepresentationofnumbers/) or [long division](https://epsilonstream.com/topic/longdivision/). Then, when presented with our curated content, there is also the option to explore these topics via the lens of exploding dots. We love mathematical exploration and we love exploding dots
