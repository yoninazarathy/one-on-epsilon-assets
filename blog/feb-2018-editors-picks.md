We are excited to present our February edition of the Epsilon Stream Editors' Picks. For this month, our team expanded to include Clara Valtorta, an incredible Mathematics Curriculum Specialist. After much discussion, research, comparison and debate, we narrowed down on a great list of mathematics videos.

 

Whether it's exploring how radio waves might help make our computers safer, finding the length of a spiral around a cylinder, or imagining a 10-dimensional sphere, the free and safe Epsilon Stream App presents you with the best of these videos. You can search the App for almost anything you can think of in the realm of K - 12 mathematics and related exploratory areas. In fact, our content team continuously updates the content in Epsilon Stream. We are parents, teachers, curriculum developers and mathematics researchers, and we just love watching and discussing mathematics videos.
