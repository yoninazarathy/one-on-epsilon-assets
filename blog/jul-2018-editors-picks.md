Our monthly Editors' picks are here! At One on Epsilon, our content team is comprised of experts when it comes to youtube mathematics videos. We are parents, teachers and mathematicians and jointly, we watch dozens of mathematics videos every week. As we do that, we discuss their style and their content. We love this process!

 

Some of these videos are then added to Epsilon Stream, our free App that allows you to watch, play and explore mathematics. Try it now. Further, a few selected videos are presented in our monthly Editors' picks. Here they are!

Infinite fractions and the most irrational number by Mathologer: You might know about fractions, but how about continued fractions? These are incredible expressions which can reveal patterns associated to many irrational numbers. How is it possible to talk about the most irrational number? Watch this video to find out, and perhaps even develop some familiarity with continued fractions!

Math for fun, how many rectangles? By Blackpenredpen: The main question here is the following: How many rectangles are there in a chess board? We can do this by simply counting out all the possibilities, but is there a clever way of doing it? After considering this yourself, check out the video and start exploring strategies that will get you thinking like a mathematician in no time.

What is Zero? Getting Something from Nothing by The Royal Institution (Dr. Hannah Fry): You might take the number zero for granted. There is nothing to it, right? It turns out zero has some interesting quirks, and even its own exceptions-to-the-rule for certain mathematical operations (e.g. can you divide by zero?). There is also a remarkable history around zero, and how it came to play a central role in modern mathematics. Watch this short video for an overview of the story of zero.

The Six Triperfect Numbers by Numberphile: After reviewing the curious class of perfect numbers, Dr. James Grime shows us an extension called the triperfect numbers. Watch this video to learn some surprising conjectures about triperfect numbers. That's right - this video talks us through an unsolved problem.

How to Draw a Perfect Circle by Vihart: How would you define a circle? OK, once you have your definition, how would you draw a circle? It is not that easy. Perhaps a tool would be useful. Even the ancient Greeks knew how helpful a compass can be for drawing a circle, and it is based largely on the circle's simple definition. This fun video gives a clue about the best way to draw one of the most elegant geometric shapes around.

Euler's formula with introductory group theory by 3Blue1Brown: A true classic from the 3blue1brown channel! This video is all about symmetry and the somewhat advanced concept of a mathematical group. By offering such a visual presentation of additive and multiplicative groups of complex numbers, Grant Sanderson's explanations might change the way you think about numbers, patterns, and mathematics. It certainly gives a fresh perspective on the famous Euler's formula.

Infinite Cake Anyone? By James Tanton: Dr. Tanton bakes a triangular cake and demonstrates a frustrating paradox that suggests a way of having an infinite supply of cake. There is an explanation, though. Can you see what it is? James Tanton is also the mathematician behind The Global Math Week - an initiative focussed on sharing joyful mathematics with children and adults all over the world.
