A Valentine from MÃ¶bius (Radcliffe Institute) by Harvard University: We found out about this great video via Mike Lawler's cool post, 15 (+1 bonus) Math ideas for a 6th grade math camp. Take a strip of paper, loop it over, and tape the ends together. Now cut it in half lengthwise. It is fairly straightforward to imagine that you end up with two loops. What happens if you twist the paper before connecting the ends? This is not so easy to visualize. Check out this short but beautiful video by mathematician Takeshi Tokieda that looks at such visualisations. Can you predict how it will turn out?

Music And Measure Theory by 3Blue1Brown: Play two musical notes at the same time on a piano. Some pairs sound pleasant, others sound quite dissonant. This video explores the relationship between such musical intervals and the mathematical problem of covering the rational numbers between 0 and 1. Can we create such a cover with open intervals on the number line, such that the sum of the lengths of the intervals is strictly less than 1? Does that sound weird? Impossible? How is this related to music? Your gut feeling may be that there is a deep association between music and mathematics. The connections made in this video are just beautiful.

When Pi is Not 3.14 by PBS Infinite Series: The famous constant Pi is always the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. You may not realise that the value of Pi is actually sensitive to the way we measure distance. In fact, you may not have realized that there are many ways to define distance. One such way is using the "taxi cab metric". This video explores this idea and beyond.
