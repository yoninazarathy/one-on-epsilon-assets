# Cut corners and save up to 29%

"I don't cut corners", he announced proudly. "I do everything by the book!". "Good for you", I replied with a grin. I then continued, "Actually, did you know that by cutting corners you can save up to 29%?"

He looked at me with an agitated and surprised look. "Where did you come up with that? T W E N T Y   N I N E   P E R C E N T!". He sounded angry. I guess he wasn't expecting me to quantify cutting corners. For him, the phrase "cutting corners" is associated with being hasty. In such cases, it often isn't clear how much you save. Indeed they say that `haste makes waste', so even if you save on work or materials, compromising quality can be damaging in the long run.

But I was not  thinking of our joint work when I brought up my 29%. I rather had a pleasant picture such as this in mind:

We see such corners in our school grounds, cities, parks and countryside. It is so often the case, that walking paths or roads intersect at right angles. When I walk, I always seek to `cut across'. Perhaps in a previous life I was a bird.

As a concrete illustration, see this Google Maps satellite image of a playing field in Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA:

Say you are at the southwest corner and wish to reach the northeast corner. According to Google, this distance of 0.5 miles, about 800 meters would take about 10 minutes to walk. But wouldn't it be better to cut across?

Walk in a north-east direction as opposed to first east and then north. This would save you about 29%, so you would walk for about 7 minutes instead of 10.

You may now ask where 29% comes from?

When you have a 90 degree corner, you have a triangle. A right triangle. Then when it comes to right triangles, you have one of the most celebrated elementary classic mathematical results of all times: The Pythagoras Theorem.  See this short video:

**Q**: Is the yellow triangle in the video a right triangle?

**A**: Yes, it has a 90 degree angle. This means that the side opposing the right angle is called the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right triangle.

**Q**: The video shows that the quantity of liquid that fits in the square created by the hypotenuse is exactly the same as the quantity of liquid fitting in the sum of the other squares. How would you describe this in words?
