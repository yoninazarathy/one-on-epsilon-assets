How Many Humans Have the Same Number of Body Hairs? by PBS Infinite Series: Kelsey Houston-Edwards (currently a Ph.D. student at Cornell University) takes a look at the simple yet powerful result known as the Pigeonhole Principle, usually attributed to the famous mathematician J.P.G. Lejeune Dirichlet (or simply "Dirichlet"). In this video, she explores a variety of applications of this principle, and discusses some pretty cool generalisations. What is your favourite application?

Turing machines explained visually by Art of the Problem: Brit Cruise describes the Turing Machine - an abstract machine that can mimic the behaviour of any other machine. What we refer to as "computable" in modern mathematics and computer science generally means that which can be calculated by a Turing machine. This is a contribution from Alan Turing that addresses one of David Hilbert's famous problems. Check out the video for details.
