Welcome to our December 2018 Editors' Picks. Here we share with you some of the neat mathematics videos that we came across during the past month.

**THE SCUTOID: did scientists discover a new shape?** by *[standupmaths](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSju5G2aFaWMqn-_0YBtq5A)*:
If you are looking for something inspiring, Standupmaths always delivers. 
In this video, Matt Parker takes us onto a journey where he explores shapes in variation of prisms. 
A collaboration between mathematicians and biologists saw the discovery of the 'scutoid' shape, which is found in cells of the epithelial tissues.
Check out this video to explore shapes that extend beyond the classroom and an exciting example of how maths can be used to solve real life problems.

**Powers of Tenâ„¢ (1977)** by *[Eames Office](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCRa-wycVfgh1ctaKaD0BeQ)*:  You may know what $10^6$ equal to -- 1000000. But do you really understand the size of $10^6$ (or if we are talking about money, how much is $10^6$)? 
What about $10^{-6}$. How to imagine that?
This video takes us on a visual tour in magnitudes, starting from a picnic to the outer edges of the universe and then returning to earth to the inside of a DNA molecule in a white blood cell.
You can see the change in size that the power of ten represents, which is quite memorising.

**Spidermath** by *[Vihart](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGeU-1Fig3rrDjhm9Zs_wg)*: Vihart has an amazing ability to discover something perhaps unnoticeable and use it to stretch the brain as much as possible.  In this video, the math thoughts come from a spider web. It is surprising to see how wide a field of knowledge a common scene in daily life can extend to.
Whether it's about a vortex or a 4D torus, can you help but wonder?
