Welcome to our December 2018 Editors' Picks. Here we share with you some of the neat mathematics videos that we came across during the past month...

If you look for something inspiring, Standupmaths never fails to surprise you. 
In this video, Matt Parker takes us onto a journey where he explores shapes in variation of prisms. 
The corporation and collaboration between mathematicians and biologists saw the discovery of the 'scutoid' shape, which are found in cells of the epithelial tissues.
Check out this video to explore shapes that extend beyond classroom and an exciting example of how maths can be used to solve real life problems.

You may know what 10 ^6 equal to -- 1000000. But do you know how big is 10^ 6(or if we are talking about money, how much is 10^6)? 
What about 10^-6. How to imagine that?
This video takes us onto a visual tour in magnitudes, starting from a picnic to the outer edges of the universe and then returning to earth to the inside of a DNA molecule in a white blood cell. 
You can see the change in size that the power of ten represents, which are quite memorising. (add the online simulations)

Vihart has an amazing ability to discover something perhaps unnoticeable and use it to stretch the brain as much as possible.  
In this video, the math thoughts come from a spider web. It is surprising to see how much field of knowledge a common scene in daily life can extend to.
Whether it's about vortex or 4D torus, can you help but wonder? (add links)
