How do you explore mathematics? Do you read, calculate, prove or perhaps just ponder? Or maybe you find examples and carry out your own research. One way to explore mathematics is to watch, play and explore videos. With literally dozens of thousands of Youtube mathematics videos available, there is certainly much to explore. How?

 

Our Epsilon Stream platform presents you with the best videos; all selected by our content team. We consider every mathematical term or activity that is found in primary, secondary and exploratory mathematics. We then search for the best videos matching each of these terms. This is much work on our end - but we love it. And it makes your experience simple. Try it now.

 

As we refine the content of Epsilon Stream, we also create monthly Editors' Picks. In this month's edition, we have some incredible resources that might just be the inspiration that you need.

Exploring other dimensions by TED-Ed: This a very inspirational video by Alex Rosenthal and George Zaidan. Have you ever imagined what our world would be like if it was 2-dimensional? This video takes the premise from Edwin Abbott’s 1884 novella, Flatland, using thought experiment that exposes 2D shapes to 3D. What about from 3D to 4D? How does 4D space look like in your mind? Watch this video and let it blow your mind!

Understanding 4D, The Tesseract by LeiosOS: Want to think more about 4D objects? Enter the Tesseract. The virtue of this cool video is the simple geometric representation of such an object when projected onto 3D. If university level mathematics isn't your thing, the linear algebra involved may seem a bit daunting. Still, consider the graphics of it all and try to appreciate that all these manipulations are quite easily done with the aid of matrices.

Rhapsody on the Proof of Pi = 4 by Vihart: Can Pi = 4? Like the usual fun doodling, Vihart presents beautiful patterns to explore concepts that seem unconventional. But hey, isn’t it the beauty of maths just to explore, regardless of right or wrong.

Solar Eclipse Maths and the Cosmic Coincidence of the Saros Cycle by standupmaths: Have you ever watched a solar eclipse? Have you ever wondered how mathematics can help predict when a solar eclipse is going  to happen? There are many factors for a solar eclipse to happen. Follow Matt Parker's explanation to explore the precision and the magic of the universe. After watching this video, think about it for a moment -- 'Is it indeed very lucky to witness a solar eclipse?'.

Correlation CAN Imply Causation! by minutephysics: Question: If more tall people have cats, you may think being tall makes people more likely to get a cat; you may think having a cat causes people to grow taller, or you may think the environment has something to do with the correlation between being tall and having cats. In fact, knowing the correlation between two things doesn’t imply that one of those things causes the other. However, does this mean that you can’t infer any causality from statistics? You can! Check out this video to find out how.

What's the probability you live in an odd numbered house? by singingbanana: What is the probability of you living in an odd-numbered house? Is it 50%? Actually, it’s 50.2%, which means that you are slightly more likely to live in an odd-numbered house than an even-numbered house. How come? In this video, James Grime uses statistical concepts to explain this bias towards odd-numbered houses and explains why the chance of the number of odd-numbered houses verses even-numbered houses isn’t 50-50.

The Leaning Tower of Lire by DONG: Take a visual tour with Michael Stevens to explore the block-stacking problem -- ‘Imagine place one block on top of the other at the edge of a table, how far can the blocks reach over to the side without falling over? ’ In Michael’s experiment, the amount of overhang follows the famous harmonic series and even though the amount of overhang becomes smaller and smaller, it will never reach 0. Think about what this means, and join Michael for the experiment.
