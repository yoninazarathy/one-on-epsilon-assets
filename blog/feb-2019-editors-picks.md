**United States of Voronoi** by [Tipping Point Math
](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwOWaOX-c-NeLnj_YGiNEg): Is there a better way to redefine the US's state boundaries in the way that makes more mathematical sense? Try to use a Voronoi diagram which is a way to partitioning regions based on distance to a special group of points. Vornodoi diagrams are applied in a variety of disciplines from biology to architecture,from transport to business. Check this video out to find out more about this interesting concept and don't be surprised if you find Manhattan is now in New Jersey after applying Vornodoi diagrams to the US map.
