**THE SCUTOID: did scientists discover a new shape?** by *[standupmaths](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSju5G2aFaWMqn-_0YBtq5A)*:
If you are looking for something inspiring, Standupmaths always delivers. 
In this video, Matt Parker takes us on a journey where he explores shapes that are a variation of prisms. 
A collaboration between mathematicians and biologists resulted in the discovery of the 'scutoid' shape, which is found in cells of the epithelial tissues.
Check out this video to explore shapes that extend beyond the classroom and an exciting example of how maths can be used to solve real life problems.

**Powers of Tenâ„¢ (1977)** by *[Eames Office](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCRa-wycVfgh1ctaKaD0BeQ)*:  You may know what $10^6$ equals, but can you appreciate the magnitude of $10^6$? How much is $10^6$ dollars? How long is $10^6$ meters?
What about $10^{-6}$? How can you conceptualize that?
This video takes us on a visual tour in magnitudes, starting at a picnic, going to the outer edges of the universe, and then returning to earth to go inside a DNA molecule in a white blood cell.
You can see the change in size that the power of ten represents, which is quite memorising.

**Spidermath** by *[Vihart](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGeU-1Fig3rrDjhm9Zs_wg)*: Vihart has an amazing ability to take something seemingly trivial and use it to stretch the brain as much as possible.  In this video, the maths thoughts come from the discovery of a spider web. It is surprising to see how a common scene in daily life can extend to a wider field of knowledge.
Whether it's about a vortex or a 4D torus, you will get caught up in the web of knowledge.
