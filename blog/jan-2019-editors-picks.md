**The Turing test: Can a computer pass for a human? - Alex Gendler** by [TED-Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA): Can an artificial machine really think? You might have seen a science fiction movie featuring artificial intelligence taking over the earth because they become too smart. For many, this has been a worrying concern for the future of artificial intelligence. In order to find out if a computer can think like a human-being, British computer scientist Alan Turing decided to focus on one aspect: Can a computer talk like a human? This TED-Ed video describes the Turing test and details some of its surprising results.

**One to One Million** by [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile): Do you know the strategy that the great Mathematician [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://epsilonstream.com/topic/gaussMathematician) used to solve the problem of adding from 1 to 100? If you know that strategy, then solving the problem of adding all the digits between 1 to 1 million wouldn't be so foreign. Only this time, the little twist is that we are not adding the numbers but adding all the digits of each number. Follow along with [Dr James Grime](https://www.singingbanana.com/) and explore this interesting little trick.

**Maths Problem: Complete Noughts and Crosses (tic-tac-toe)** by [singingbanana](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMpizQXRt817D0qpBQZ2TlA): How many ways are there to completely fill a Noughts and Crosses (tic-tac-toe) board, with four noughts and five crosses, not including rotations and reflections? The problem presented by [Dr James Grime](https://www.singingbanana.com/) once again get us thinking.
