At One on Epsilon we thrive on great YouTube mathematics videos. Viewers from across the globe watch mathematics content for [nearly 5 Million hours per month](https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream/#data-analysis). That is a lot of mathematics, and we have only counted videos in English. Clearly there is more.

It shouldn't surprise you that [our team](https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream/#content-team) spends dozens of hours a week watching YouTube mathematics and improving the Epsilon Stream experience. We are teachers, mathematicians, and parents. Our goal is to make [Epsilon Stream](https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream/) your first stop mathematics reference tool.

The free Epsilon Stream platform presents the best content from the web in a unified and clear experience.

As we do every month, our Editors' Picks presents you with a few selected high quality videos across a range of topics and channels. Let's get started!

Is it Better to Walk or Run in the Rain? by Minute Physics: It’s raining and you forgot your umbrella. The question is this: is it better that you calmly walk under the rain? Or are you better off running as fast as you can until you find somewhere to hide? The question might seem obvious, or perhaps not? Watch this video and find out! Although it is about physics, it also deals with volume. In fact, this video relates mathematical content to the physical world, making it more relevant to real life.
