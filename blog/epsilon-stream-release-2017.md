# Epsilon Stream Release: Sep 15

**One on Epsilon Team**

We don't have a mathematical blog post for this week. Instead, try and guess what we are working on? ... It is our premier free service for the public:  Epsilon Stream - Watch, Play and Explore Mathematics.

 

Epsilon Stream will be available on September 15. This free iOS App is a safe and curated content streamer designed to give you the best mathematics that the web has to offer. Our content team comprised of parents, teachers and mathematics researchers is now focusing on content curation for Epsilon Stream. We are curating youtube videos, articles and games that span the breadth of mathematics - following the multiplication table and preceding the details of calculus. Look out for Epsilon Stream and let us enhance your mathematical lifestyle.

 

For the past months we have been releasing weekly blog posts dealing with mathematical exploration, curiosity driven mathematics, imagination, love, open problems and more. Thousands of readers have visited the site, many have registered and shared the content with friends, family, colleagues, students and teachers. Thank you for all your support. Our blog posts will continue to appear on fortnightly basis. In the meantime, don't hesitate to look through the past 40 blog posts - perhaps you missed one or two on the way.

It isn't a coincidence that Epsilon Stream's release date of September 15 aligns with the Global Math Week, October 10 - 17, 2017. This year's focus is on Exploding Dots, and Epsilon Stream will help with that too. Exploding dots content is integrated into Epsilon Stream, making the app a great tool for viewing youtube videos associated with Exploding Dots and the Global Math Project.
