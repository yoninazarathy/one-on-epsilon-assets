The Global Math Week by James Tanton: Not too long ago, James Tanton introduced the cool idea of Exploding Dots and together with thousands of educators, used it as the main theme for the 2017 Global Maths Project. This year, the Global Math Week, starting on 10-10-2018 features Exploding Dots again, this time with even more fun, creativity and exploration. Check out this cool video to learn more about the Global Math Project. Then chase back other exploding dots content to gain deeper insight. Get involved in the maths world in a truly global way with millions of educators, learners, enthusiasts  -- and watch the dots explode!

The dollar game by Numberphile:  Have you ever played the dollar game? After you explore this cool game, you can ask: in what situations is winning even possible? This simple game will prompt curious learners to explore graph theory. Plus, it’s fun! Follow Dr. Holly Krieger’s lead first, and then check out this blog by Matt Baker for a more detailed explanation of the theorems involved in this game and other applications.

Visualising irrationality with triangular squares by Mathologer: This inspiring Mathologer video has visual proofs of why √2, √3, √5, and √6 are irrational numbers. Using √3 as an example and the method of contradiction, Burkard Polster shows us the discovery of infinitely many nearest miss solutions where the ratio of the solutions converges to √3. For those eager to find out more, this paper by Steven J. Miller and David Montague can be a good starting point.

Why can't 1 be prime? By GoldPlatedGoof: You probably already know that 1 is not considered a prime number. But why? In this video, Nakul Dawra examines many explanations as to why 1 is not prime, and, in particular, that thinking of 1 as a unit gives more conceptual understanding of the concept of prime and unique prime factorization. In fact, there are many other explanations of why 1 isn’t a prime. For a challenge, come up with your own understanding and explanation.

The Brachistochrone, with Steven Strogatz by 3Blue1Brown: The word ‘Brachistochrone’ in Greek means ‘the shortest time’. The Brachistochrone problem explores the curve along which a particle travels the fastest, or, in another word, takes the shortest time. Johann Bernoulli posed this problem in 1696 as a challenge to the mathematical world and the top mathematicians of the time raced to find a solution. As usual, 3Blue1Brown presents sophisticated mathematical concepts using beautiful visuals. Sit back, think hard, and enjoy the clever ideas developed by generations of mathematicians.
