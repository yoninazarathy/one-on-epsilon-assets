Do mathematics result age and become obsolete? The pure answer is generally "no".  As the field is based on clean axioms and logical deductions, what was true hundreds or thousands of years ago, remains true today.

How about mathematics videos? After all, mathematics on YouTube is big business. There are dozens of quality channels and tens of thousands of videos. Do Mathematics videos age? That is, are older mathematics videos loosing relevance? Read on...

At One on Epsilon, we continously follow YouTube mathematics content and include the most relevant content that we find in [Epsilon Stream](https://epsilonstream.com). A good part of the process involves the expertise of our [content team](), however other aspects are automated. For example, our system automatically tracks YouTube mathematics videos from dozens of channels. 

A by product is that every month we update [our estimate](https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream/#data-analysis) of the number of hours of mathematics watched on YouTube during the past month. This number typically lies at a value between 4 Million hours and 5 Million hours! That is a-lot of math - and that is in English alone.

For the month of November, there were 4.25 million hours of mathematics video views. More on how we do this is in this [blog post](https://www.1onepsilon.com/single-post/2018/08/07/Counting-Mathematics-on-Youtube).

So back to the question: do mathematics videos age? Rephrased differently: 

**Out of the 4.25 million hours watched how many were new? How many were from a year ago? How many were a few years old?**

We analyzed the hours watched per quarter and created the following:

As you can see, it is certainly not the case that most hours watched were from the past year or two. As opposed to that, the past 5 years contribute to most of the hours watched in a rather uniform manner. This suggests the following:

**Like mathematics itself, YouTube mathematics videos also have the ability to stay relevant for long durations** 

Yes, mathematics has existed in human knowledge for thousands of years and YouTube is much younger. Still, within the world of YouTube videos we see that great content created half a decade ago, still remans very relvant today.
