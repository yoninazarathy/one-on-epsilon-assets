In its purest form, mathematics does not age. You can consider mathematics results and discoveries from centuries ago and they are still very relvant today. As the field is based on clean axioms and logical deductions, what was true and relevant hundreds or thousands of years ago, remains true and relevant today.

How about mathematics videos? After all, mathematics on YouTube is big business. There are dozens of quality channels and tens of thousands of videos. Infact, there is so much quality stuff out there that it drove us to create [Epsilon Stream](https://epsilonstream.com). 

Back to the question: Do Mathematics videos age? That is, are older mathematics videos loosing relevance? Our answer is no. Read on to see why.

At One on Epsilon, we continously follow YouTube mathematics content and include the most relevant content that we find in Epsilon Stream. A good part of the process involves the expertise of our [content team](), however some aspects of the process are automated. For this process, we continously track YouTube mathematics videos from dozens of channels. 

As a side product, every month we update our estimate of the number of hours of mathematics watched on YouTube during the past month. This number typically lies at a value between 4 Million hours and 5 Million hours! That is a-lot of math - and that is in English alone.

For the month of November, there were 4.25 million hours of mathematics video views. If you are interested in the method we used 

This graph illustrates the age distribution of videos watched during November 2018.

According to our estimate, there were 4.25 Million hours viewed. But what was viewed? How old was it? Well, as the graph shows, a good part of what was viewed is videos from the past 5 years with roughly a uniform distribution over the past 5 years?
