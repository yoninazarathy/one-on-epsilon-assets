Mathematics on YouTube is big business. There are hundreds of channels and tens of thousands of videos. You can search for "volume of parallepeiod", "how to divide fractions" or even for "are there more irrational numbers than rationals". Key such things in YouTube and you get an array of videos, many of which are great.

Our Free Epsilon Stream App refines the experience. If you search for such terms in our App, you will not be bombarded by dozens of results, you will rather get a short response with content that we ensure is right for your query. 

To get this to you, much of what we do is curate content. We watch it, sort it and make sure that the best content for the right queries appears in Epsilon Stream. Some of the process involves automation, however most of it relies on the experience of our content team. A group of mathematicians, parents and educators.

Nevertheless, the main supply of content for Epsilon Stream is YouTube and for this we continuously track the content of YouTube mathematics channels. Every month we update our estimate of the number of hours of mathematics watched on YouTube during the past month. This number typically lies at a value between 4 Million hours and 5 Million hours! That is a-lot of math.

For this month, we thought to present you with a slightly more refined view. How old is the mathematics content consumed via YouTube?

This graph illustrates the age distribution of videos watched during November 2018.

According to our estimate, there were 4.25 Million hours viewed. But what was viewed? How old was it? Well, as the graph shows, a good part of what was viewed is videos from the past 5 years with roughly a uniform distribution over the past 5 years?
