Youtube has it all! You can use Youtube to learn how to cook, to program, to swim or to fix a bicycle. You can watch videos that showcase history, science, nature, culture and our world. Do you ever use Youtube to search for mathematics content? 

 

There are dozens of Youtube mathematics channels, varied in style, nature and focus, but mostly interesting, precise and incredibly inspirational. The total number of subscribers to these channels is estimated at more than four million with the number of individual views estimated at over a billion. Channel creators have certainly put considerable effort and care into this incredible body of Youtube math content, and the public has accepted it with open hands.

 

We estimate that the total number of mathematics videos in these channels exceeds ten thousand. Watching the bulk of the mathematics content would take you a few good weeks of non-stop video streaming. Do you have that time?

 

As an alternative, you can use Youtube search for individual items. It can work well, but often, you get bombarded with dozens of results and don't find exactly what you are looking for. So how to effectively get Youtube math content? One great way is to use the free Epsilon Stream App. Here is a demo video:

A key point of Epsilon Stream is that it focuses on mathematics. Some of the content is about "how" while other content is about "why", promoting curiosity and exploration. Keep in mind that using Epsilon Stream does not contradict subscribing directly to the channels that you like the most. 

 

Let us survey some great Youtube math channels that caught our attention:
