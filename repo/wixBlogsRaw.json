This week has us thinking about joyful, global mathematics, and how mathematics can bring people together from all across the globe. As we mark this week, we can also consider how different mathematics subjects are interconnected to give us exciting ways of exploring similar concepts.</div><div>For example, have you ever wondered why we take math classes in a set order? Although the classes seem to cover different skills, often the same phrase or concept appears across multiple subjects. For example, the word tangent shows up in algebra, geometry, and calculus. Then, have you ever wondered how this concept is connected across these math courses? Is the concept of tangent different in each one?</div><div>Let’s explore how a tangent line interacts with a circle. A tangent line of a circle is a line that passes through exactly one point on the circle, or the point of tangency. The slope of the tangent line changes as the point of tangency rotates around the circle.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_9dbd78bf99614528ac9c35636a22b773~mv2.png\"/><div>In elementary algebra, slope is defined as the change along the y-axis versus the change along the x-axis. To find the equation of the tangent line given the point of tangency at this level, a typical approach might involve:</div><div>Identifying another point on the radius of the circle that includes the point of tangency, which can be the center of the circle;Finding the slope of this radius and then the slope of the perpendicular slope;And, using the negative reciprocal and a point to find the equation of the tangent line, which can be done using the point-slope form:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_46714b28ccdd4926abfc552447f7f0af~mv2.png\"/><div>The same concept of tangent line can also be explored through calculus. In fact, a large part of calculus is the study of change, and, more specifically, instantaneous change. Calculus has a wide range of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fqVT-DfpGg&amp;t=20s\">applications</a> ranging from mathematical models representing stock markets to taking rockets to space. Evaluating derivatives in calculus means finding the rate of change, and in the case of a circle, it allows us to find the slope. You may think, &quot;Great, but why do I need another way of finding the slope?&quot; Here is the beauty: the first derivative gives us the equation to find any slope along any smooth curve, not just circles.</div><div> Now, consider the circle centered at (0, 0) with a radius of 1.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_9e37d75adad542d5bc0ad232ade610e1~mv2.png\"/><div>It can be represented via the set of <div>(x, y)</div> points that satisfy the equation,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_71e3b2dc051347b1a1e7e98d4736b899~mv2.png\"/><div>By applying a derivative to both sides of the equation, we easily find out the slope of the tangent line at any point <div>(x, y)</div> on the circle, as long as y is not 0. For example, the slope of the tangent line at (0.8, 0.6) will be</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_1875f1ae045947599a196e10f0ab7397~mv2.png\"/><div>Then, by using the point-slope formula, we get</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_9dd06f3ac1c64d7ab432d022dc937463~mv2.png\"/><div>In fact, the first derivative allows us to easily find the equation of any tangent line to this circle given the point of tangency, again, as long as the y-coordinate does not equal 0. This same tool makes it easy to examine the angle relationships of tangent lines as well.</div><div>Here is a case where tangent lines of circle appear in geometry. If we build on the previous example and create an additional tangent line, there is an angle at the point where the two tangents intersect. </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_3b779680da3f489d8f7a94062f55e300~mv2.png\"/><div>By using trigonometry ratios, we can find the angle of intersecting tangent lines and then use inductive reasoning to infer one of the key theorems in geometry:</div><div>The measure of the angle created by the tangent lines is half the difference of the arc measures created by the tangent lines:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_77b74f7ef936448694fbabb6ef8646ab~mv2.png\"/><div>As you grow in your math knowledge, you are not just learning discrete concepts, rather, you are making connections between previously learned concepts. For example, without a firm understanding of slope, the first derivative is meaningless. Mathematics is a subject built from the bottom up, and the seemingly simple concepts learned in elementary mathematics courses are the foundation. The beauty is that as you develop deeper mathematical knowledge, often prior concepts becomes clearer, and you gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of them as well. </div><div>In the video below by James Tanton of the <a href=\"https://www.globalmathproject.org/\">Global Math Project</a>, you can explore how geometry can be laced with arithmetic to explore a different approach of finding squares of numbers.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/80mINNY_zps\"/><div>How about you? Have you made connections between concepts taught in different mathematics courses? Did you learn concepts later on in your math education that made earlier concepts clearer? For example, would it be better if we learned about positive and negative numbers through algebra directly?

Thank you Andres!</div><div>A few years ago, a Facebook poll asked: &quot;Do you live in an odd numbered house or an even numbered house?&quot; Outright, it is not the most interesting of questions, but watching <a href=\"http://www.greatmathsteachingideas.com/2011/08/07/whats-the-probability-you-live-in-an-odd-numbered-house/\">James Grime's engaging video</a> describing the surprising results may change your mind. After watching this video, we decided to squeeze a bit more mathematical exploration out of the poll results.</div><div>So, let's start with an overview of results of the poll. As described by James Grime, the first results he saw were 125,710 odd and 124,653 even. A few days later, the results were 211,803 odd and 209,964 even. So, in both cases, about 50.2% of the participants reported living in an odd numbered house. A natural question is: Why not exactly 50%?</div><div>One may initially believe that such a seemingly slight deviation from 50% is due to statistical error. For example, if we tossed 1000 fair coins, there would be nothing surprising if 502 of them landed on tails. However, with the large sample size of the poll, it is not statistically likely to obtain these results if the true probability for odd is really 50%.</div><div>Still, why?</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wydlZ9lcEiQ\"/><div>Even though in general, there are <a href=\"https://www.1onepsilon.com/single-post/2017/03/04/Are-There-More-Evens-Than-Odds\">just as many even numbers as odd numbers</a>, consider streets with an odd number of houses. Generally, they will have one more odd numbered house. <div>For example, a street with three houses would have houses numbered 1, 2 and 3. That is two odds and only one even. A street with 11 houses would have six odd numbered houses and only five even houses. Notice though, that the more houses on the street, the less the percent of odd houses differs from 50%. For example, a street with 1001 houses has 501 odd houses, which is about 50.05%. And a street with 4501 houses has about 50.01% odd. Still, when averaging over all possible street sizes, there are slightly more odds than evens.</div></div><div>This is where we went a step further. Based the results of the poll, this was our objective:</div><div>We want to estimate the number of houses per street.</div><div>We found out that on average, there are 644 houses per street. At least that is our estimate. How did we do that?</div><div>Before we dive in, let's assume a simpler, hypothetical situation. We live on a planet with only two types of streets: those with two houses, and streets with three houses. We'll use the percent of people living in odd numbered houses from the poll, or 0.502. In our equations, α represents this proportion; so α =0.502. We do not know the proportion of streets that have two houses or the proportion of houses that have three houses. Let's define the unknown proportion of streets that have two houses as <div>p. </div>Then, <div>(1 - p)</div>is the proportion of streets that have three houses. </div><div> Let N equal the number of houses on a street. If N is 2, the probability of a randomly selected house on that street being odd is 1/2. If N is 3, or there are 3 houses on the street, the probability of a randomly selected house on that street being odd is 2/3.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_4e7a142ce8a54f10afca38421427f363~mv2.png\"/><div>Here we use the idea of <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/probability-events-conditional.html\">conditional probability</a>. The strength of conditional probability is that it allows us predict the value of α by conditioning on the value of N. To do this, we'll find the sum of the products of the probability of randomly selecting an odd house for each value of N and the proportion for that value of N. Here it is:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_616e02b02de54866b1cfe4de4f45c92c~mv2.png\"/><div>We can solve for p to representit in terms of α.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_080668eda4824b979a8f7ac603aa79e5~mv2.png\"/><div>The expected number of houses per street, or E[N], can be represented by the following equation.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_32639bfd900d498eaa565f65ce9b5537~mv2.png\"/><div>Can you explain why we multiplied p by 2 and <div>(1 - p)</div> by 3?</div><div>Previously, we found p in terms of α. Now substitute that expression for p, and we get this expression for E[N].</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_def8b34ebcca4dd09d0148b7adbb274b~mv2.png\"/><div>We can now use this expression. When α = 0.502, <div>E[N] = 2.012</div>. That is, under the (unrealistic) assumption that there are two or three houses per street, the expected number of houses per street is just slightly over 2. What if the poll reported the percent of odd numbered houses as 60%, or α = 0.6? Then the expected number of houses per street would be 2.6.</div><div>Extension Questions: What is the maximal α possible? What is the minimal?</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_998694cdef79422dbda0919b207eb861~mv2.jpg\"/><div>And now back to reality.... streets do not only have two or three houses. In reality, for a randomly chosen street, the number Nis a random variable that can essentially take any positive integer value. However, we are still interested in estimating the number of houses per street, or E[N].</div><div>When we assumed N could only be 2 or 3, it was clear that the probability distribution of Nwas determined by the single number,p. However, for a more general N, there are many options for its form and shape of its distribution. Which one should we choose?</div><div>Here there isn't a single correct answer. In fact it is here where, if we don't have other information, we need to make a leap and make some choices. It is here where mathematical analysis transforms into mathematical modelling. We needed to chose a distribution that on the one hand appears realistic and plausible while on the other hand is easy enough to manipulate mathematically. We chose a geometric distribution. </div><div>With the geometric distribution, the chance of <div>N = k</div>, is given as follows:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_0986d0f189144f5fae86e191e351f558~mv2.png\"/><div>Here the parameter p is a number in the range (0, 1). If you know about infinite geometric series, you can check that the sum of probabilities above, over <div>k = 1, 2, 3,...</div> up to infinity equals 1. With a bit more algebra, you can even verify that <div>E[N] = 1/p</div>. </div><div>Now, having assumed a geometric distribution, we can do some computations and try to obtain E[N]. For this, the key formula is</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_ca7c2ec83ee448e58a9715a4ec0b2153~mv2.png\"/><div>As we had in our simpler, hypothetical situation, the equation relates α with the unknown parameter p. Only this time, since N can take any value of <div>k = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...</div>, we need to sum over all possible (infinite) possibilities. If you want a refresher on this Sigma (summation) notation, check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jwXThH6fg4\">this video</a>. </div><div>Now we ask, what is the probability that a randomly chosen house on a street with N houses is odd?</div><div><div>Well, for an even value of k this conditional probability is just 1/2. Then for an odd value of k it is <div>(k + 1)/(2k)</div>. </div><div>Can you see why? Try it for <div>k = 1, 3, 5,</div> and 7.</div></div><div>With these ingredients in place, all that remains is to try and find the p which yields the correct α. This isn't done with analytical ease, so we approximate this value with numerical computations. Details are <a href=\"http://es-app.com/blog-assets/streetSize.pdf\">here</a>. Our end result is that <div>E[N] = 644</div>.</div><div>We estimate that the mean number of houses on each street is 644.</div><div>Is it really the mean street size? Frankly it seems a bit high. Still, it is not an unreasonable estimate and the nice thing is that it is based on a single empirical number 0.502 and some cool mathematics and modeling.</div><div>Where else in science, geography or engineering does one make such leaps and go from a measured number such as 0.502 to an estimate such as 644? We believe there are plenty of cases where such practice takes place. Where? What do you think of these mathematical leaps? <a href=\"https://oneonepsilon.com/contact/\">Let us know</a>. </div></div>\n"

Have you ever imagined what our world would be like if it was 2-dimensional? This video takes the premise from Edwin Abbott’s 1884 novella, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland\">Flatland</a>, using thought experiment that exposes 2D shapes to 3D. What about from 3D to 4D? How does 4D space look like in your mind? Watch this video and let it blow your mind!</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6kn6nXMWF0\"/><div>Understanding 4D, The Tesseract by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/LeiosOS/\">LeiosOS</a>: Want to think more about 4D objects? Enter the Tesseract. The virtue of this cool video is the simple geometric representation of such an object when projected onto 3D. If university level mathematics isn't your thing, the linear algebra involved may seem a bit daunting. Still, consider the graphics of it all and try to appreciate that all these manipulations are quite easily done with the aid of matrices.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iGO12Z5Lw8s\"/><div>Rhapsody on the Proof of Pi = 4 by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGeU-1Fig3rrDjhm9Zs_wg\">Vihart</a>: Can Pi = 4?

Have you ever wondered how mathematics can help predict when a solar eclipse is going to happen? There are many factors for a solar eclipse to happen. Follow <a href=\"http://standupmaths.com/\">Matt Parker</a>'s explanation to explore the precision and the magic of the universe. After watching this video, think about it for a moment -- 'Is it indeed very lucky to witness a solar eclipse?'. </div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ieUvzy6rnnw\"/><div>Correlation CAN Imply Causation! by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHW94eEFW7hkUMVaZz4eDg\">minutephysics</a>: Question: If more tall people have cats, you may think being tall makes people more likely to get a cat; you may think having a cat causes people to grow taller, or you may think the environment has something to do with the correlation between being tall and having cats. In fact, knowing the correlation between two things doesn’t imply that one of those things causes the other. However, does this mean that you can’t infer any causality from statistics? You can! Check out this video to find out how. </div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HUti6vGctQM\"/><div>What's the probability you live in an odd numbered house? by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMpizQXRt817D0qpBQZ2TlA\">singingbanana</a>: What is the probability of you living in an odd-numbered house? Is it 50%? Actually, it’s 50.2%, which means that you are slightly more likely to live in an odd-numbered house than an even-numbered house. How come? In this video, James Grime uses statistical concepts to explain this bias towards odd-numbered houses and explains why the chance of the number of odd-numbered houses verses even-numbered houses isn’t 50-50.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wydlZ9lcEiQ\"/><div>The Leaning Tower of Lire by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClq42foiSgl7sSpLupnugGA\">DONG</a>: Take a visual tour with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stevens_(educator)\">Michael Stevens</a> to explore the block-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-stacking_problem\">stacking problem</a> -- ‘Imagine place one block on top of the other at the edge of a table, how far can the blocks reach over to the side without falling over? ’ In Michael’s experiment, the amount of overhang follows the famous harmonic series and even though the amount of overhang becomes smaller and smaller, it will never reach 0.

This project, coupled with an interesting <a href=\"https://www.1onepsilon.com/single-post/2018/03/02/Thinking-outside-the-coordinate-plane/\">geometry class</a>, got me thinking about how we discuss the origin and development of mathematics.</div><div>Recently I’ve noticed that the history of mathematics is completely ignored in math class. This leaves out interesting, human aspects of mathematics. It also may prevent students and teachers from addressing the rich question:</div><div>Is mathematics invented or discovered? </div><div>I know, I know, there is no “correct” answer to this question. But that does not make it a worthless question. This question ties together history, math, and philosophy. It may engage younger learners who are unmotivated by the procedural and repetitive aspects of classroom mathematics.</div><div>My goal with this blog post is to encourage everyone - students, mathematics teachers, people who work with maths, and those who do not - to think about this topic. So, I have been asking friends and acquaintances their opinions. Here are some of their responses to think over.</div><div>How do you define discovered? Invented?</div><div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-bartlett-4958ab15a/\">Nicholas Bartlett</a>, One on Epsilon data scientist:</div><div>In my opinion, these two words mean the same thing, but we usually say discovered in physical space and invented in &quot;conceptual space.&quot; I think of all ideas as already existing as if buried in the earth, somehow latent in the connected space of concepts, and simply waiting for something to do the work necessary to unearth it. An argument in support of this point of view is that discoveries in physical and conceptual space occur in a certain order, according to &quot;inaccessibility.&quot;</div><div>James Tanton, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.globalmathproject.org/\">Global Math Project</a>:</div><div>If you open your fridge and see a chocolate fudge cake sitting inside, you wouldn't say that you created (invented?) that cake, but instead that you discovered it. That seems clear.</div><div>If you open your fridge and you see in it all the ingredients sitting there for you to make a chocolate fudge cake, and then you make the cake, you might likely say that you created the cake, not invented it, but you didn't invent or create the building blocks of it - the butter, the eggs, the chocolate, etc.</div><div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yousuf-marvi-896a2b11/\">Yousuf Marvi</a>, high school math teacher and One on Epsilon content editor:</div><div>For something to be invented, it must have an inorganic origin. If the origin of math is in symbolic representation, then we can call the symbolism invented. If it’s in logic, then it’s an adaptation; if it's about finding a way representing numbers, then it is discovered.</div><div>Mathematics, is it discovered or invented?</div><div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-isaac-9755706/\">Phillip Isaac</a>, university mathematics lecturer and researcher and One on Epsilon content editor:</div><div>I would have to say both. There is certainly a feedback loop of discovery/invention in mathematical research. For example, once results are discovered as a result of something invented like a definition, it is often the case that a mathematician would go back and &quot;tweak&quot; that definition to understand the effect on the results that follow.</div><div>Yousuf Marvi:</div><div>I think it is mainly invented just like languages are. If I borrow from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cgpfw4z8cw\">Chomsky's Language Acquisition Device theory</a>, all brains have the capacity of language hardwired; however, humans have figured a way out to generate several different unique languages. Similarly, reality might exist but humans invented math to understand it.</div><div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoni-nazarathy-2740252a/\">Yoni Nazarathy</a>, university mathematics lecturer and researcher and One on Epsilon content editor:</div><div>As a mathematics researcher working in stochastic modelling (also known as applied probability), I love to invent my own problems. This often involves inventing mathematical models that exhibit “interesting behaviour” or come with built-in “interesting questions” or “challenging problems.&quot; Not much discovery in this part of my work, just invention, invention, invention. </div><div>However, what makes mathematical models interesting? A model is interesting if you can discover interesting things about it. That is, once done inventing, I’m left standing in front of nature. In front of the mechanics of the model. In front of the delicate intricacies of the beast. From that point onwards, an incredible process of discovery takes place. Making good discoveries is a rare occurrence, but when they happen I feel great joy.</div><div>Frederick Powell, middle school mathematics teacher:</div><div>I believe that math was invented because I feel that there was a need for a counting and a data system during ancient civilization. In my opinion, when we invent something, we create something. Therefore math is invented to help world systems thrive and make numbers applicable to worldly situations.</div><div>James Tanton:</div><div>It feels like, to me, there are basic building blocks (eggs, cocoa beans, cane sugar, wheat stalks, etc) and new blocks that have been put together from them (chocolate, butter, ground wheat), and that, when doing math, I put them together in different ways. I usually make fudge cakes - things known to the world - but every now and then I make something not (publicly) known to the world at all. (So very rarely and usually not interesting!). But I never I feel I can say the word &quot;invented.&quot; I feel like I simply discover how building blocks can be put together in new ways (and these can become new blocks to play with later on).</div><div>I think mathematics is such a hard and demanding (and therefore appealing and intriguing) enterprise that it generates a sense of humility and awe. &quot;Discovering&quot; feels more fitting to say with that sense of awe</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c378cd0a3a4742dca0c8a90e46ad23c6~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Does it matter?</div><div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/coco-bu-0481a9100/\">Coco Bu</a>, high school mathematics teacher and One on Epsilon content editor:</div><div>I guess it matters for mathematicians to realize what it is out there that they need to find and what it is they need to come up with themselves in order to find what's out there. But for me, as an educator, I am more curious about how maths knowledge is explained, delivered and imparted to my learners. Whether it's a theory that is discovered or something people invented or put together, as long as I communicate with my students where the origin is, I don't see it is a big matter for them considering their curriculum.</div><div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/azzurra-crispino-b1662353/\">Azzurra Crispino</a>: Associate Professor of Philosophy:</div><div>It does matter in terms of whether we say that mathematical truths are truths, or they are merely constructions and that those constructions may be used to model truth more or less accurately. I think the constructivist (invented) view is left holding the bag that we can approach truth but never have certainty that we have attained it, whereas the realist (discovery) view has the potential for attaining mathematical Truth. Of course, if it turns out that Mathematical Truth (tm) does not exist, then attempting to attain it is a lost cause. On the other hand, if it is possible to attain it, and we do not because we believe ourselves to merely be constructing it, that would be a loss, too. </div><div>Ultimately, I am unsure whether this has question makes any practical application changes for those researching mathematicians and logic. But I do think that what position you take on this question may very well change the kinds of approaches and assumptions that you make in your mathematical theorizing. I have long advocated that theorists should be required to list all of their theoretical assumptions at the beginning of a science, math or logic paper, in the same way we list key words. That way, those who are not making the same assumptions can easily know that is the difference, and if some of those theoretical assumptions turn out to later be shown false, we have a way of easily indexing the articles to see what previously held truths need to be revisited.</div><div>Phillip Isaac:</div><div>I'm not really sure how to answer this. In a sense, my opinion is irrelevant. It is what it is.</div><div>Yousuf Marvi:</div><div>How we define the origin story of Math definitely matters. Often learners think that math is some grand reality that is beyond their reach; hence, math becomes a factor of ability. However, if we consider the idea of the invention, then we can entertain creativity and hence, subjectivity.</div><div>Frederick Powell:</div><div>Even though I feel that math is invented, it really doesn't matter in today's classroom. Teachers are spending the school day making math applicable to everyday situations. Students are not invested in the origins of math, rather they invested in how to use math that benefits them and their endeavors.</div><div>________________________________</div><div>This topic has been debated and written about extensively. Here are some other great resources to further develop your point of view:</div><div><div>A HuffPost blog post by Derek Abbott: <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/derek-abbott/is-mathematics-invented-o_b_3895622.html\">Is Mathematics Invented or Discovered?</a></div><div>An article by David Babuschkin, full of great quotes and historical references: <a href=\"http://theunapologists.com/mathematics-invented-or-discovered\">Mathematics: Invented, Or Discovered?</a></div><div>An engaging TED-Ed video with a link to related questions and additional resources: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_xR5Kes4Rs\">Is math discovered or invented? - Jeff Dekofsky</a></div><div>In this article, Mario Livio introduces the terms active and passive to describe the applicability of mathematics to describe our world. <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2015/04/great-math-mystery/\">Math: Discovered, Invented, or Both?</a></div></div><div>________________________________</div><div>Mathematics is often portrayed as being uncreative, stagnant, and mechanical.

Dozens of incredible creators upload engaging, precise, surprising and useful content, dealing with almost every aspect of exploratory and educational mathematics.</div><div>At One on Epsilon, a key mission of our <a href=\"https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream/#content-team\">content team</a> is to organize and present this content in a manner that is useful for students, educators and enthusiasts. To do that, we regularly call upon our experts to personally sort, evaluate and select the best mathematics videos. Members of our team are equipped with a proprietary back-end software tool that we created for this purpose. The fruits of our labor are then found in the free Epsilon Stream platform. </div><div>But that is not all. Clearly, with the aid of <a href=\"https://www.1onepsilon.com/single-post/2017/06/09/Machines-and-Mathematics-Play-Together\">machines</a>, we can understand more about the YouTube content, its significance, volume, usage and the like. For this we began a data science project, mining information from YouTube, specifically focusing on mathematics content. Our goal with this project is to better understand the world of YouTube mathematics, as well as to deliver interesting bits of information and summary statistics to the hard working community of <a href=\"https://www.1onepsilon.com/single-post/2017/09/10/Incredible-Mathematics-on-Youtube\">YouTube mathematics content creators</a>.</div><div>Our <div><a href=\"https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream/\">first</a><a href=\"https://oneonepsilon.com/epsilonstream/#data-analysis\">report</a></div> in this project is quite brief and minimal. We plan to update the figures in this report on a monthly basis. It currently reads as follows:</div><div>We conduct an on-going survey of YouTube mathematics usage. For the month of July 2018 our conservative estimate indicates that in the English language alone, there were 1.8 million hours of mathematics views. Yes, that is 1,800,000 hours of mathematics videos educating, engaging and exploring audiences!</div><div>This is equivalent to 2 million people, each watching 12.5 minutes of mathematics videos per week!</div><div>This conservative estimate excluded significant channels such as Khan Academy, TED-ED, minute physics and Vsauce. </div><div>Translating 1.8million hours of viewing to the (example) statistic of 2 million people, each watching 12.5 minutes a week is rather straightforward. But how did we get the number 1.8 million? We now outline a few details.</div><div>Our data collection system operates by periodically pulling information through the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/\">YouTube API</a>. This is an open free service that YouTube provides for the general public. We capture viewing information for a list of mathematics videos, published by channels that we know produce mathematics content. See <a href=\"https://www.1onepsilon.com/single-post/2017/09/10/Incredible-Mathematics-on-Youtube\">our survey</a> of many of these channels.</div><div>Our list of videos currently contains more than 34,000 videos! There is a possibility that some of the videos in our database are not mathematics videos, but given the channels that we use for the collection, these are a minority.</div><div>To calculate the hours of mathematics viewed in July, first we determine how many times each video in our database has been viewed in July. YouTube videos keep a running total of how many times they've been viewed since they were first posted - this is called the view count. With our data collection system, we know the view count of each video at any point in time - the difference in the view count between the start and end of the month is the number of views in that month! For videos with a view count higher than 300, YouTube applies a special filtering algorithm to make sure that view counts are not being pumped up by web bot activity or by attempts to game YouTube’s statistics. This makes view counts much more reliable and useful!</div><div>Then we multiply the number of views in July by the duration of the video. We then multiply this by 0.35. This is our guesstimated magic constant which allows for the fact that not every viewer watches a video all the way to the end. Note that we are trying to be as conservative as possible in our estimate. Communication with creators such as <a href=\"http://gdaymath.com/about/\">James Tanton</a>, the mastermind behind the <a href=\"https://www.explodingdots.org/\">Exploding Dots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globalmathproject.org/\">The Global Math Project</a>, indicate that typical numbers may be at values of around 0.40 or even 0.50 depending on the type of video and the time of year. </div><div>Finally, we sum up all the individual video viewing hours and - voilà! This gives us an estimate for the total number of hours of mathematics content watched.</div><div>This is just the starting point of our data science process supporting Epsilon Stream. There will be more to come and more refined updates of the mathematics watch rate. Some highly viewed channels such as TED-ED and Khan Academy were not included in this initial survey because we didn't want to accidentally count videos that are not about mathematics. Our future updates will be able to count specific videos from these channels and others that deal with mathematics. </div><div>Stay tuned for more by <a href=\"https://oneonepsilon.com/register/\">registering with us</a> and/or following on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oneonepsilon\">twitter</a>. </div></div>\n"

In my case, there isn't a day that goes by in which I don't think about some sort of an &quot;average.&quot; However, I seldom have a specific mathematical concept in mind. Instead, I think about the average representing a &quot;typical value&quot;. </div><div>For example, I believe that &quot;on average&quot; I spend a total of 45 minutes a day on phone conversations. On some days I spend more than 45 minutes and on other days less. Then as a measure of central tendency, 45 describes the typical value.</div><div>Clearly, if I would actually measure how long I speak per day over a few days, then I could also calculate this average. How would I do that? The common way is the arithmetic mean where I would sum up the daily measurements and divide by the total number of days. </div><div>OK, so we understand arithmetic means. Though, as you may know, there are other common accepted ways of describing &quot;typical values&quot;. For example, as we explored in an <a href=\"https://www.1onepsilon.com/single-post/2017/05/27/Choosing-a-Fair-Estimate\">earlier blog post</a>, the median is also a very popular measure. Then there are related terms such as weighted averages, truncated means and mathematical expectations.</div><div>However, let's return to the arithmetic mean - sometimes just called &quot;the mean&quot;, &quot;the sample mean&quot; or &quot;the sample average&quot;. It turns out that it has two related friends - far less popular: the geometric mean and the harmonic mean.</div><div>All three means, the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic are generally called Pythagorean means. This is due to geometric reasons arising in the case of two data values. We won't go into the geometry of it (see this brief <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagoreanMeans.html\">MathWorld description</a> if you are interested). Instead, let's ask: </div><div>When is each of the Pythagorean means best used as a &quot;typical value&quot;?</div><div>Before we introduce (or review) the way we calculate each of these means, let's consider three distinct scenarios that require a typical value, denoted by A.</div><div>(i) Total calculations: Say you are about to carry N items and wish to estimate the total weight you will carry. In this case, if A is the average item weight, then clearly,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_10ab79eef98e45ff80d790ee9684b4f7~mv2.png\"/><div>(ii) Return on investment calculations: Say you invest K dollars in a savings account for a duration of N years. If the average growth rate per year is with a factor of A then after N years you have:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_8458022b79c240fea677661d8c1f4dd8~mv2.png\"/><div>This is because after the first year, you have <div>K x A</div> and after two years you have <div>K x A x A</div>, etc. Note that if there is an interest rate of r involved, then <div>A = 1+r</div>. For example with a 5% interest rate, <div>A = 1.05</div>.</div><div>(iii) Distance-time-speed calculations: Say you are traveling for a distance of N kilometers at an average speed of A km/hour. In this case, the time travelled is:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_84fcce632e59449da9fb6eddb5a9956b~mv2.png\"/><div>In each of the cases (i) - (iii), the average value, A, signifies a typical quantity. That is a typical weight in case (i), a typical growth factor in case (ii) and a typical speed in case (iii). Indeed, if all we know is A, then we would probably use the above formulas without trouble.</div><div>However, what if we are actually given data matching each of these scenarios? How would we compute the desired average A, matching the data? For example, what if <div>N = 4</div> and we were given,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_e6461b4dbcae409f8bc932c5d3d9d278~mv2.png\"/><div>Keep in mind, the meaning of of these data values depends on the context:</div><div>For case (i) these values represent 4 individual weights, say in kilograms.</div><div>For case (ii) these values represent growth factors for each of the 4 periods. For example, the first value of 1.05 represents 5% growth and the second value represents 15% decay.</div><div>For case (iii) let's assume that these values represent the speeds taken over consecutive kilometres when traveling for a total of 4 kilometres. That is the first value represents a speed of 1.05 km/h during the first kilometre of motion, the second value represents a speed of 0.85 km/h during the second kilometre and so on. </div><div>These are quite slow speeds, so assume we are walking over tightrope. Four kilometres of balancing -Yikes!</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_2b879308bfe64b74a53b739618dd47a4~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Clearly, depending on the scenario, the numbers have very distinct meanings. Then how could we compute an average value A? Exploring the three Pythagorean means will help us get some context.</div><div>Arithmetic mean: This is simply the sum of the values divided by the total number of values:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_629c76b56d38411e88676c89aa8d0ba3~mv2.png\"/><div>Geometric mean: This is the N'th root of the product of values. For example, if there were only two values, you would multiply them and take their square root. In our case, <div>N = 4</div> and hence:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_e44c328ebd6643f187925cab6419d2e8~mv2.png\"/><div>Harmonic mean: This is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals. That is, instead of each value, consider its reciprocal, sum these up and divide N by that sum. For <div>N = 4</div> we have:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_83dd1cd0541748f3895818d53d027ff7~mv2.png\"/><div>You can observe that the means are not exactly the same. In-fact, the following inequality always holds:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_116f8618c339487fb91184680c000203~mv2.png\"/><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_794d5e7c02a94dbf97342ad07767eeba~mv2.jpg\"/><div>OK, so we know how to calculate these means. So what?</div><div>Why ever use the geometric or harmonic mean? Why not just stick to the arithmetic mean?</div><div>To answer this, let's return to the cases (i), (ii) and (iii) above. Ideally, we would like a &quot;typical value&quot; to correctly summarise the information found in the individual values. Follow the calculations below to see how this plays out:</div><div>Case (i): Try and use the arithmetic mean:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_dc10ba8617b74f288afa3596bdeecac4~mv2.png\"/><div>That seems to work well! As desired, the total weight is exactly reproduced.</div><div>Case (ii): What type of mean should we use in place of A? It turns out that the arithmetic mean doesn't do a good job. Instead try the geometric mean:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_ae6ac5c2b2134dbf80cb79900f0e5b21~mv2.png\"/><div>Hence by using the geometric mean, we have found the exact return over the period of 4 years. Numerically, notice that</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c128b006808f4c6ca7a17289ea862781~mv2.png\"/><div>As you can see, starting withK dollars and we end up with <div>1.6065 x K</div> dollars after 4 years. This is an average growth factor of 1.1258 per year, or about 12.6% per year. Note that it would have been wrong to use the arithmetic mean, implying 15% per year.</div><div>Case (iii): Here speed varies over each kilometre of travel. If we would just average out the speeds using the arithmetic mean yielding 1.15 km/h, using it in the time = distance/speed formula would yield an inaccurate result. Instead, try the harmonic mean:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_aeb66e899f3447979dd7333ad8097340~mv2.png\"/><div>This is the desired quantity because</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_a65ef2741e2941bf95dcc4d74b85e777~mv2.png\"/><div>Try out the numbers and see that the total time is 3.6289 hours. This is significantly different than the value of 4/1.15 = 3.478 hours obtained by (wrongfully) using the arithmetic mean. Can you think of other contexts where the harmonic mean is useful? </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_07b870cd27e64a11883efe3cd50f5389~mv2.jpg\"/><div>So in summary, there are different ways of finding &quot;typical values&quot; depending on the context. In practice, the arithmetic mean is the most common way. However, for specific contexts involving growth rates, the geometric mean works better and for contexts involving rates or speeds, the harmonic mean does the job perfectly.</div><div>A related post describing similar ideas aimed at data-scientists is <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/on-average-youre-using-the-wrong-average-geometric-harmonic-means-in-data-analysis-2a703e21ea0\">here</a>.

Here they are! </div><div>Infinite fractions and the most irrational number by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg\">Mathologer</a>: You might know about fractions, but how about continued fractions? These are incredible expressions which can reveal patterns associated to many irrational numbers. How is it possible to talk about the most irrational number? Watch this video to find out, and perhaps even develop some familiarity with continued fractions!</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaasbfdJdJg\"/><div>Math for fun, how many rectangles? By <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_SvYP0k05UKiJ_2ndB02IA\">Blackpenredpen</a>: The main question here is the following: How many rectangles are there in a chess board? We can do this by simply counting out all the possibilities, but is there a clever way of doing it? After considering this yourself, check out the video and start exploring strategies that will get you thinking like a mathematician in no time.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uq9OXC0Gzgw\"/><div>What is Zero? Getting Something from Nothing by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw\">The Royal Institution</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hannahfry.co.uk/\">Dr. Hannah Fry</a>): You might take the number zero for granted. There is nothing to it, right? It turns out zero has some interesting quirks, and even its own exceptions-to-the-rule for certain mathematical operations (e.g. can you divide by zero?). There is also a remarkable history around zero, and how it came to play a central role in modern mathematics. Watch this short video for an overview of the story of zero.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Y7gAzTMdMA\"/><div>The Six Triperfect Numbers by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A\">Numberphile</a>: After reviewing the curious class of perfect numbers, <a href=\"http://singingbanana.com/\">Dr. James Grime</a> shows us an extension called the triperfect numbers. Watch this video to learn some surprising conjectures about triperfect numbers. That's right - this video talks us through an unsolved problem.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DhPtIf-hpuU\"/><div>How to Draw a Perfect Circle by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGeU-1Fig3rrDjhm9Zs_wg\">Vihart</a>: How would you define a circle? OK, once you have your definition, how would you draw a circle? It is not that easy. Perhaps a tool would be useful. Even the ancient Greeks knew how helpful a compass can be for drawing a circle, and it is based largely on the circle's simple definition. This fun video gives a clue about the best way to draw one of the most elegant geometric shapes around.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QncgmzH6yQU\"/><div>Euler's formula with introductory group theory by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw\">3Blue1Brown</a>: A true classic from the 3blue1brown channel! This video is all about symmetry and the somewhat advanced concept of a mathematical group. By offering such a visual presentation of additive and multiplicative groups of complex numbers, Grant Sanderson's explanations might change the way you think about numbers, patterns, and mathematics. It certainly gives a fresh perspective on the famous Euler's formula.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mvmuCPvRoWQ\"/><div>Infinite Cake Anyone? By <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCib_J32VI8rQI_LCFXn1XAA\">James Tanton</a>: <a href=\"http://www.jamestanton.com/\">Dr. Tanton</a> bakes a triangular cake and demonstrates a frustrating paradox that suggests a way of having an infinite supply of cake. There is an explanation, though. Can you see what it is? James Tanton is also the mathematician behind <a href=\"https://www.theglobalmathproject.org/\">The Global Math Week</a> - an initiative focussed on sharing joyful mathematics with children and adults all over the world.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7e-LByl_68\"/><div>We hope you enjoyed. <a href=\"https://oneonepsilon.com/contact/\">Let us know</a> what you think.

In fact, what is the first thing that comes to mind when I ask you that question? I love gardening, and for me, one of the most fascinating things about plants is to see the patterns in how they grow. For example, is the leaf arrangement opposite or alternate? Is the leaf form compound or simple? What colour are the flowers? Identifying such patterns allows us to classify the type of plant, which leads to a better understanding of what grows in our garden. So, what does this have to do with mathematics?</div><div>You may have read several of our blog posts that suggest that mathematics is, more or less, the study of patterns (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.1onepsilon.com/single-post/2017/07/15/Seeking-Patterns-with-Math\">Seeking Patterns with Math</a>). Such an endeavour can help us to identify and classify different mathematical structures, which ultimately leads us to a deeper understanding of mathematics as an art, a science, and a tool. In this blog post, we look at mathematics relating to polygonal numbers, sometimes also known as figurate numbers.</div><div>Let’s start with the triangle. If you draw an equilateral triangle and mark the vertices as dots, there are three dots. Now extend two adjacent edges, and make a bigger triangle. Iterate this process as in the following diagram: </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_e9b2f90818fd413b9ca06049f0f12ede~mv2.png\"/><div>How many dots are there with each iteration? Proceeding in this way, we generate a sequence of positive integers. Note that we start at 1, which can be thought of as the trivial triangle, i.e. where the shape collapses to a single point. The result is the sequence of the triangular numbers: </div><div>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, ...</div><div>Do you notice any patterns in this sequence? One that stands out is the difference of each consecutive number, given by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... In other words, each of these numbers is the sum of consecutive integers. For example, </div><div>28 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7.</div><div>Enter Carl Friedrich Gauss. Gauss was a famous German mathematician whose work has made a huge impact on modern mathematics and physics. As a child in the 18th century, he was notoriously precocious. One story, perhaps an urban myth, tells of a frustrated school teacher who instructed a misbehaving Carl Gauss to add all the numbers from 1 to 100, in order to keep the child occupied for quite some time. Unfortunately for the teacher, the young Gauss devised the following shortcut.</div><div>The sum of the numbers, T, can be written in two ways:1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100 = T,</div><div>100 + 99 + 98 + ... + 3 + 2 + 1 = T.</div><div>Sum up corresponding terms on both sides of each equation to give</div><div>101 + 101 + 101 + ... + 101 + 101 + 101 = 2 x T.</div><div>In the sum on the left, the number 101 is being added to itself 100 times. This means the left hand side is just 101 x100 = 10100. (You may also try <a href=\"https://www.1onepsilon.com/single-post/2016/11/17/Push-Ups-Sit-Ups-and-Adding-Numbers/\">Push Ups, Sit Ups and Adding Numbers</a> to think about it!)</div><div>Therefore T = 10100/2 = 5050. It turns out this is a triangular number. </div><div>In fact, thanks to the young Carl Gauss, we can see that every triangular number can be written in a similar form. Actually, the nth triangular number is given by the formula (n+1)n/2. Here we are using the typical mathematician’s place holder of &quot;n&quot; as an integer variable. For example, if n=1, then “nth” or “1th” is read as “first”. If n=2, “nth” or “2th” is understood as “second”, “5th” as fifth, and so on. We then just replace n in the formula for the actual number. Try it: </div><div>28 = (8 x7)/2, </div><div>36 = (9 x 8)/2,</div><div>and so on.</div><div>Here’s an idea: Can we extend this to other regular polygons, like squares, pentagons, hexagons, and so on. The answer is: Yes!</div><div>Try applying a similar principle in drawing squares with growing lengths (again, starting at 1), as we did the triangles. A picture would develop something like this:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_a3fdaba1fa124b1db53b10c430034978~mv2.png\"/><div>The number of dots in each iteration gives the square numbers:</div><div>1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, ...</div><div>In this case, the formula for each number is easy. The nth square number is given by n^2 (i.e. &quot;n squared&quot;). What about the differences of consecutive square numbers? These are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, ... In other words – and this is cool – the square numbers are the sums of consecutive odd numbers. For example, </div><div>49 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13.</div><div>Now set the number of sides to 5. Playing the same game with regular pentagons (that is, five-sided polygons), generating the sequence of numbers might take a bit of effort, concentration, and possibly some artistic talent. Try to follow the progression in the following diagram, and maybe reproduce some more for yourself:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_38a7a3ca7b0f4640a3864ed9e8fe99df~mv2.png\"/><div>Counting the number of dots in each iteration gives the following sequence:</div><div>1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, ...</div><div>These are known as the pentagonal numbers. What is the pattern here? The differences of consecutive pentagonal numbers are 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, ... So, for example, the pentagonal numbers are the sums of consecutive number, starting at 1, that differ by 3. For example: </div><div>70 = 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 + 16 + 19.</div><div>What about a formula for the nth pentagonal number? We could use the same principle put forward by Gauss. The nth pentagonal number, P can be written as </div><div>1 + 4 + 7 + ... + (3n-8) + (3n-5) + (3n-2) = P,</div><div>(3n-2) + (3n-5) + (3n-8) + ... + 7 + 4 + 1 = P.</div><div>As we did with the triangular numbers, sum up corresponding terms on both sides of each equation to give</div><div>(3n-1) + (3n-1) + (3n-1) + ... + (3n-1) + (3n-1) + (3n-1) = 2P.</div><div>In the sum on the left, the number (3n-1) is being added to itself n times. This means the left hand side is just (3n-1)n. Therefore P = (3n-1)n/2. Try some examples: </div><div>70 = (3 x 7 -1) x 7/2, </div><div>92 = (3 x 8 -1) x 8/2,</div><div>and so on.</div><div>It is at this point, we can say “AHA! There is a pattern!” Consecutive triangular numbers have a difference of whole numbers (that differ by 1). Consecutive square numbers have a difference of odd numbers (that differ by 2). Now we see that consecutive pentagonal numbers have a difference of a sequence of numbers that differ by 3. Could it be that this pattern extends to numbers associated with hexagons (6-sided), heptagons (7-sided), octagons (8-sided), and so on? Indeed, that is the case.</div><div>If you can, try to verify some of the following results by drawing pictures of growing hexagons, heptagons, octagons, and by extrapolating. The result is the following table of numbers, with p being the number of sides of the polygon:</div><iframe src=\"//static.usrfiles.com/html/19b9fe_4221d4f24ed20772454d6b5f78fc4a6a.html\"/><div> Here is where you can let your inner mathematician roam free. What patterns do you notice in this table? How about the differences across each row? Are there any interesting patterns down diagonal entries? Could you apply the Gauss idea to find a formula for the nth entry in each column? (We have already worked out a formula for columns p=3, p=4 and p=5).</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_0a9d3b4a9e85422b8b7b1ae09703bb9b~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Could you work out a formula for arbitrary p? Here is the big challenge: Is it possible to reproduce a similar table for number sequences related to three-dimensional polyhedra? Are there any restrictions on the numbers of edges or faces in this case? </div><div>I hope you enjoy playing with these patterns. Happy exploring!</div></div>\n"

Let's get started!</div><div>How Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider\">Business Insider</a>: This video presents an interesting idea developed by Eratosthenes, an ancient Greek mathematician who estimated the circumference of the earth. Are you curious about how Eratosthenes did this? Pause the video at 1'38'' and see if you can figure out his method with the given information.</div><div>Eratosthenes's clever thinking uses <a href=\"https://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/non_Euclid_fifth_postulate/index.html\">Euclidean Geometry</a>, methods from <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trigonometry.html?ref=theblueish.com/web\">trigonometry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/circumference.html\">circumference</a> of a circle, and <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/proportions.html\">proportions</a>. His approximation turned out to be quite close to modern measurements. It is truly a spark of an idea over 2,000 years ago that came from a brilliant mind.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mw30CgaXiQw\"/><div>Did you notice that according to the video, Eratosthenes used the unit of stadia to measure the distance between Alexandria and Syene? Stadia (or Stadium in Latin) was an ancient Greek unit of length. Today, the exact distance of a stadia is not agreed upon. Perhaps this dispute can affect the result of Eratosthenes's calculation.

For example, a 10% grade means that a biker climbs 1 vertical meter for every 10 horizontal meters. Indeed, even a 10% grade is challenging for an average biker.</div><div>As for professionals, take for example, the the 2013 edition of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirreno%E2%80%93Adriatico\">Tirreno-Adriatico</a> race. There many professional cyclists ended up walking their bicycles over a 27% grade. Understandably, such a steep grade can be tiring, especially since you are covering more distance than is apparent on a map; however, consider this:</div><div>The 27% incline covered only a small fraction of the 3km climb. 3km out of 209km! </div><div>Furthermore, if we measure the degrees of the gradient using trigonometry, we see that a 27% grade is only about 15 degrees- that’s quite a small angle! So what creates the uphill struggle?</div><div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c4a1e8f4452b48889a00e0afd4d7b43c~mv2.png\"/><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_2d8637bd07354059afeb2489a913702f~mv2.png\"/></div><div>It turns out the answer to our challenge is measured in Watts - a unit of power that measures the rate of energy transfer. We, as bodies in motion, generate power. The amount of power (P) we generate going on a slope is a product of velocity relative to the ground (v), mass (m), gravity (g), and the slope (s). The resulting equation is</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_9aaef776682e4ca2a6c2eedc8f88ce20~mv2.png\"/><div>Let's now explore how changes in the gradient (slope) affects Watts. The beauty of the above formula is that it shows that if velocity, mass and gravity are kept constant, then the Power needed is approximately proportional to the grade. However, in the calculations below we use a more advanced model that also incorporates other aspects such rolling resistance (friction) and air drag.</div><div>For this let's create a cyclist profile that assumes certain characteristics.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c608e49107ec4dee9113d2a7074cb3ec~mv2.jpeg\"/><div>Let’s assume that Joshua weighs 70kg (m) and rides the bike at a constant 20km/h (v) over a horizontal distance of 3.33 km (part of the slope). To find out the rate of Power output for each increment in incline, we will use a cool tool developed by <a href=\"http://elmo.sbs.arizona.edu/sandiway/\">Sandiway Fong</a> at the University of Arizona, USA. This is the <a href=\"http://www.u.arizona.edu/~sandiway/bike/climb.html\">Climbing Power Calculation tool</a>. In addition to considering the above inputs, the tool allows us to specify the style of bicycle riding and the bike weight. </div><div>So what can we infer from the information? Consider the graph below as we compare the amount of Watts Joshua’s body needs for every additional graident, assuming that he maintains a constant speed of 20 km/h and the same seated position (air drag) on his bicycle. He will have to produce approximately 40 Watts for every gradient. Clearly, as the data suggests, inclines are very difficult! To go up each additional percent of gradient, Joshua would have to keep doubling his Watts output.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_558e644219a44dd1981697352e8cdb09~mv2.png\"/><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_d8b3180b6cf14e48948094240679ba9f~mv2.png\"/><div>As if it is not daunting already to double the Watts output for each additional gradient, when we evaluate the percentage increase of Watts needed for each additional gradient, we realize how much more power is needed compared to going on a flat ground. </div><div>Just going from 0% to 2% incline, Joshua would have to produce 147 Watts; 126% more than his output on a flat ground! </div><div> As the website <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2017/06/just-how-good-are-male-pro-road-cyclists/\">CyclingTips</a> helps us to put things in perspective, a very advanced rider can only maintain about 400 Watts for approximately 11 mins. As you might imagine, Joshua will start to get tired pretty fast, the steeper he goes. However, to be fair, our model has a very unfair restriction on him.</div><div>Joshua doesn’t have to bike at a constant 20km/h, nor does he have to maintain the same seating position. Changing his posture and lowering his speed will make it much easier for him to bike up the incline - in fact, that’s what most of us do anyway. Regardless, the model does a remarkable job of helping us understand the relationship between going up on an incline and power. </div><div>And now a challenge question: Assuming Joshua is a professional cyclist who can sustain creating 450 Watts over a duration of 10 mins, what’s the steepest gradient he could bike up, assuming he can’t change his speed or biking position? You may use Fong’s Climbing Power Calculator or create your own table based on the equation. </div><div>Please <a href=\"https://oneonepsilon.com/contact/\">share your results with us</a>. We would love to hear from you! </div></div>\n"

What does it mean for a statement to be true? Are some statements more true than others? Think about the last time someone asked you a question. When you responded, was there a clear distinction between a true answer and a false answer?</div><div>In regular day to day communication, often the issue of true vs. false can become quite a grey area. What about truth in mathematics? In mathematical logic, statements are taken as either true or false. In this post, we consider some examples of circumstances where this thinking can lead to a contradiction. Enter the paradox.</div><div>A paradox can mean many things in mathematics. Sometimes it refers to a result that is counter-intuitive or unexpected. Other times it refers to a situation that results in an incorrect conclusion because of a subtle error or incorrect assumption made somewhere along the way.</div><div>Here, we would like to explore a well-known paradox that occurs in the context of mathematical logic known as Curry’s Paradox. Before we delve into Curry’s Paradox, let's consider a simpler logical paradox.</div><div>Consider the following statement:</div><div>This sentence is false.</div><div>Think about this for a moment. If the sentence is actually false, as it claims to be, then the sentence must be true. Alternatively, if the sentence is true, then the sentence must be false! Hang on, we’re going in circles here! This statement is an example of a logical paradox, that is, a statement that is inconsistent with logic. The paradox arises due to the statement referring to the value of its own truth.</div><div>In using the word logic here, we mean that every statement is either true or false, but it cannot be both true and false. Furthermore, if a statement is not true, then it is false, and vice versa.</div><div>In order to carefully examine and understand Curry’s Paradox, let’s first explore compound statements. A compound statement is one that is made up of two or more statements. Here is an example of a compound statement:</div><div>It is raining or the kids are playing outside.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_5c48407376c44ba081c2a44be48ec2ce~mv2.jpg\"/><div>We can use brackets to separate out the distinct statements.</div><div>(It is raining) or (the kids are playing outside).</div><div>Let’s set A to represent the statement “it is raining” and B to represent the statement “the kids are playing outside.” Our sentence is then:</div><div>A or B.</div><div>One way to analyze a compound statement is by using a truth table. This is a table that keeps a record of all possibilities of the truth-value of each statement. These values are used to determine the value of the compound statement.</div><div>There are two possible values for statement A, true or false. There are two possible values of statement B, true or false. The compound statement, &quot;A or B&quot; uses the Boolean operator OR. We can think of it as, &quot;When A and/or B is true, this statement is true.&quot; Here is the truth table for &quot;A or <div>B&quot;</div>:</div><iframe src=\"//static.usrfiles.com/html/19b9fe_d9d73d166a22d91d384ec9156d96ede7.html\"/><div>Note that the compound statement &quot;A or B&quot; is only false if A and B are both false.</div><div>Two statements are logically equivalent if their truth tables are the same. It might seem strange at first, but another way of conveying the meaning of that original sentence is the following logical conditional statement:</div><div>If (not A) then B</div><iframe src=\"//static.usrfiles.com/html/19b9fe_5c1bcc358a785435f14c3dbd6c53ca93.html\"/><div>Let’s look at this a bit more closely. If “not A” (the hypothesis) is true, then the entire statement can only be true if B (the conclusion) is also true.</div><div>We must be very clear to take the statement at face value and not interpret anything further than what is being said. The overall statement makes no claim in the case the premise is false. Look at the actual statement again: “If it is not raining then the kids are playing outside.” No claim is being made about where the kids play if it is raining. So, when it is raining, or &quot;not A&quot; is false, the compound statement is not false, and is therefore true.</div><div>The situation represented by these logically equivalent statements can be summarized in the following diagram:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6bb53ac0138f42fabd88f06a54e08968~mv2.png\"/><div>Now we can have fun with Curry’s Paradox!</div><div>We find ourselves in quite a logical mess if we make a statement about that very statement's truth or falsehood in a compound logical statement, especially one with a nonsensical conclusion. Consider:</div><div>This sentence is false or zero is equal to one.</div><div>Set C to represent the statement “this sentence is false” and D to represent the statement “zero is equal to one.” The form of the sentence simplifies to:</div><div>C or D.</div><div>Looking through our mathematical lens, we produce this truth table as before:</div><iframe src=\"//static.usrfiles.com/html/19b9fe_a22b1830b3f737d9f7b56225df31fb6f.html\"/><div>Here is where the logical paradox arises. In rows 1 and 2, C is true. However, C is a statement that refers to its own value. When C is true, this corresponds to saying that the statement “this sentence is false” is true, which means the sentence is false. That is inconsistent with the value in the right-most column. </div><div>Something similar occurs in row 4, where C is false. This corresponds to saying that the statement “this sentence is false” is false, which means that the sentence is true. Again, we see in the right-most column, in row 4, that the full sentence is false in this case. So far, it has all been inconsistent.</div><div>What about row 3? Well, the entries for &quot;C&quot; and &quot;C or D&quot; seem to be logically consistent. Great! What about the entry in the column for &quot;D&quot;? That corresponds to D being true. Unfortunately, that would mean that the statement &quot;zero is equal to one&quot; is true. Eeek! This goes against our broader experience and knowledge, and indeed the foundations of mathematics! So everything is a mess: Indeed, it's a paradox!</div><div>By the way, another common presentation of this paradox is the conditional statement:</div><div>If this sentence is true then zero is equal to one.</div><div>If you are interested in looking at other types of mathematical paradoxes, check out this video on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox\">Banach-Tarski paradox</a> by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA\">VSauce</a>:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s86-Z-CbaHA\"/><div>You can also check out the “proof” that pi = 4 by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart\">Vihart</a>:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2xYjiL8yyE\"/><div>Although neither of these are a logical paradox like Curry's Paradox, they demonstrate that mathematics is more than just a set of rules that we follow to make intuitive deductions. There is so much more richness to mathematics!</div><div>Do you have a favourite mathematical paradox? Is it just impossible to decide? Well, the word “impossible” is not in our vocabulary!</div></div>\n"

It was a week where over a million students stepped into the zone of joyful mathematics. The focus was <a href=\"http://gdaymath.com/courses/exploding-dots/\">Exploding Dots</a>, a fascinating and fun way to explore numbers, arithmetic, algebra and many related concepts. It was global, truly global! But was it &quot;math&quot; or was it &quot;maths&quot;? </div><div>In the United States, mathematics is abbreviated as &quot;math&quot;; however, in many other parts of the English speaking world, it is &quot;maths&quot;. So should we say &quot;Global Math Week&quot; or &quot;Global Maths Week&quot;? </div><div>Does it actually matter? </div><div>Mathematics is a study of ideas and thoughts. It is the development of logical conclusions that arise from earlier assumptions and explorations. In its pure form, mathematics is universal. It can be used to describe many natural and physical phenomena. It helps create and engineer advanced, cutting-edge algorithms and systems. For some, it is recreational and can be seen as an art form; for others it is a core activity used to predict, plan, and optimize. As observed in the Global Math(s) Week, it can bring joy to many inquisitive minds of all ages, genders and nationalities. So perhaps it doesn't matter what you call it or how you spell it. Just do it!</div><div>Since mathematics can be built from basic axioms and assumptions, it is in many ways universal. But what about the language used to describe the concepts? Well, there are more than 400 languages in the world that are each spoken by more than a million people. So clearly, describing mathematics will sound different in each language. However, for our purposes, let's focus on the English language, spoken by about a fifth of the world population. Specifically, we wish to seek some peculiar differences between British mathematics terminology and American mathematics terminology. We've already pointed out &quot;maths&quot; vs. &quot;math&quot;. On that matter, you may also want to watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A\">Numberphile</a> video with <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/115259\">Lynne Murphy</a></div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbZCECvoaTA\"/><div>You may want to ask,</div><div>Within the English speaking world, what terms in mathematics are not global<div>? Do any terms clash?</div></div><div>Well in fact, there aren't many stark differences, only a handful. Sure, things are sometimes said a bit differently in different places. For example, our organization's name, &quot;One on Epsilon&quot; is naturally interpreted in the UK and Australia as dividing 1 by the variable &quot;Epsilon (ε)&quot;. However in North America, you would probably say &quot;One divided by Epsilon&quot;. A British mathematician may also tell you that <div>Epsilon (ε)</div> is a positive quantity very close to &quot;naught&quot;. An American mathematician probably wouldn't say &quot;naught&quot; but just &quot;zero&quot;. See this interesting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_the_number_0_in_English\">Wikipedia entry</a> for a discussion of names of zero.</div><div>You've also got other historical differences, such as the fact that in the UK, a &quot;billion&quot; used to stand for a &quot;million million&quot;. But wait, isn't that a &quot;trillion&quot;? Check out this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVI-AT2fwvmpDEYPoHlcsWQ\">Oxford Dictionaries</a> video:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MDG-uHJobI\"/><div>Yet, these differences are historical. Today, the world has agreed on the value of a billion as 10⁹ and the value of a trillion as 10¹². More on that from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-52AI_ojyQ\">Numberphile</a>.</div><div>Now, putting historical differences and slight word abbreviations aside, you may ask:</div><div>What are the current significant differences in mathematics between UK English and North American English?</div><div><div>Well, that question has been asked and answered plenty of times. A cute comprehensive description is in this <a href=\"https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2015/05/20/us-vs-uk-mathematical-terminology/\">Math with Bad Drawings</a> blog posted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benorlin\">Ben Orlin</a>, where he focuses on commonly used classroom terminology.</div>Based on our investigation, we would like to point out two major differences that we found: </div><div>(1) The phrase &quot;surd&quot; is not used in North American mathematics, however in UK and Australian terminology it is popular.</div><div>(2) &quot;Trapezium&quot; and &quot;trapezoid&quot; take on completely different meanings in the UK and North America.</div><div>&quot;Surds&quot; are a bit &quot;Absurd&quot;</div><div>When we, the authors Coco and Yoni, aren't working on One on Epsilon stuff, we are busy in our &quot;day jobs&quot; in the formal education sector. Coco is a secondary school teacher in Australia, and Yoni is a university lecturer and researcher. With that as background, see how this discussion between us evolves: </div><div>Coco: Hey Yoni, have you heard of &quot;surds&quot;?</div><div>Yoni: It is not a term that I use, but I know the term is used in secondary schools in the UK, Australia and a few other places outside of North America. Can you remind me what a &quot;surd&quot; is?</div><div>Coco: Sure. Here is one common definition:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_109f1b6b44f04750a37b1dbd10e1ee68~mv2.png\"/><div>Yoni: Ah, I see. For example, if n=2 (square root) and x=3, we have √3, and according to my calculator:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_1ab841a8c9d24e3aad5fbcc5c8f0e60b~mv2.png\"/><div>Coco: Indeed, this is an <a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/single-post/2017/02/25/Get-Irrational-Impress-Your-Kids\">irrational number</a> because the digits after the decimal go on forever without a repeating pattern. </div><div>Yoni: But you know Coco, this term isn't used in North America at all. I even ran an informal Facebook poll on it in a math education forum. The results strengthened my belief that most North Americans have never heard of it.</div><div>Coco: Wow, that is surprising, in Australian schools (and the UK) we use this term.</div><div>Yoni: Well, in mathematics academic circles all over the globe, it isn't a commonly used term. Frankly, in my view, it is kind of an &quot;absurd&quot; term.</div><div>Coco: Funny that you say that. The word &quot;surd&quot; comes from the latin word &quot;surdus&quot; which stands for &quot;deaf&quot; or &quot;mute&quot;. The same goes for the origin of the word &quot;absurd&quot;. I guess irrational numbers, as real as they are, may at times seem absurd. But why do you think surds are absurd?</div><div>Yoni: Well, look at this,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_0b3c37e44fec4884bb2b7409c36be57f~mv2.png\"/><div>Coco: Oh, so what?</div><div>Yoni: You see, the expression on the left and the expression on the right are equal and are irrational. However, the one on the left is a surd (n=4, x=2) and the one on the right (n=2, x=√2) isn't a surd because x is not rational. Isn’t that absurd?</div><div>Coco: Well, while the values are the same, calling a mathematical expression a &quot;surd&quot; has to do with a particular form. Frankly, in teaching the term is often used loosely as follows:</div><div>When we can't simplify a number to remove a square root (or cube root etc), then it is a surd.</div><div>Yoni: Oh, I see. This agrees with discussions on the <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/surds.html\">maths is fun</a> page. What else do you know about surds?</div><div>Coco: Well, let me ask you another question. You can take a square root of a number and get a rational number that isn't an integer, right?</div><div>Yoni: I guess so. Like √1.44. Yes, that would be equal to 1.2.</div><div>Coco: Right. Before, I asked you to take a square root of a number and now, I want you to take a square root of a positive integer. Now, tell me, can you get a result that is a rational number but not an integer?</div><div>Yoni: Ah... you don't want an integer, so I should exclude √4, √9, √16, √25, √36 .... and think of square roots of integers that aren't perfect squares: √2, √3, √5, √6, √7, √8, √10, √11, √12,.... </div><div>Coco: Yes, exactly. Now here is a lovely claim: All those roots (of non-perfect squares) are going to be irrational numbers. It can be proved by contradiction, but we won't discuss the proof now - we'll leave that for a different day.</div><div>Yoni: Oh, that is kind of cool to know. I'd love to see the proof, but assuming it is correct, I guess there is a bit of sense in the phrase &quot;surd&quot;. This is because:</div><div>A square root of an integer is either a whole number or a surd!</div><div>Trapezium vs. Trapezoid</div><div>Moving on from surds, consider this shape:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_b255823edc264b9c826d05c8b01e592b~mv2.png\"/><div>In North America, it is a &quot;Trapezoid&quot; because it is a quadrilateral with a pair of parallel sides. However, in the UK, this shape is called &quot;Trapezium&quot;. So you see, this shape has a different name in the UK and the US. See this cool <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBuMwlP7kHkNxdPAqtFSJTw\">Mathantics</a>video (you may start at the time 3:40):</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yiREqzDsMP8\"/><div>However, be careful! In American English the word &quot;trapezium&quot; also has a meaning:</div><div>In North America, a quadrilateral with no parallel sides is sometimes called a &quot;trapezium&quot;. </div><div>Confusing? Still, let's take it all in perspective. This is perhaps the most significant difference in mathematics between UK English and American English. Is it manageable? It probably is! If the differences within the English language don't go beyond what we presented above, then maybe Mathematics really is global?

I was taking a Modern Geometry course, and the instructor started a section on non-Euclidean geometries. Up until this point, I was used to hearing the term geometry, singular, not geometries, plural. As far as I was concerned, Euclidean geometry (that is, geometry on a flat surface) was the only geometry, or the only way to study points, lines, shapes, and space. Throughout the semester we explored something totally different. These non-Euclidean geometries could be used to prove seemingly outlandish theorems, claiming things like rectangles do not exist and the interior angles of a triangle add up to something other than 180°. As an example, the surface of some coral can be used as a model of a geometry known as hyperbolic geometry.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_00b33697bba8417a9c27f2171e8e355c~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Phil: What is hyperbolic geometry? Why was it even developed?</div><div>Clara: It was largely developed in the 1800s by mathematicians <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai\">Bolyai</a>and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Lobachevsky\">Lobachevsky</a>. They, like many others, had an issue with Euclid’s 5th postulate. Well, Euclid called it a postulate, but in the context of an axiomatic system, it’s like an axiom.</div><div>If you want a quick refresher of Euclid’s postulates, which are the building blocks of Euclidean geometry, this list provides a summary: </div><div>You can connect any two points with a line.You can extend any line indefinitely.You can describe a circle with a center point and a radius.Right angles are congruent.If two lines intersect a third line so that the sum of the inner angles on one side of the third line is less than two right angles, then you can extend the first two lines so that they intersect on that side.</div><div>Alternatively, sing along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC35Ka5W9L3LTGKvvZlQiDHQ\">TheSingingNerd</a>:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZrU7MpKGPw\"/><div>Phil: Mmm... Euclid's 5th postulate is wordy and reads more like a theorem.</div><div>Clara: I agree, however mathematicians had not been able to prove it as a theorem resulting from only the first 4 postulates. Bolyai and Lobachevsky's main contribution to geometry was to use Euclid's first 4 postulates to define hyperbolic geometry, but not the 5th. Here is a great video by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqwKh-_s_C15XGdOBEjc_5Q\">Uncommon Nonsense</a> explaining this point in the context of hyperbolic geometry :</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mOjSllxp7Y\"/><div>Phil: How can you model hyperbolic geometry? On a coordinate plane?</div><div>Clara: Hyperbolic geometry was initially modeled with a crazy looking thing called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudosphere\">pseudosphere</a>.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_003040303297415da94f7ac077512420~mv2.png\"/><div>There were several other mathematical models, like the Poincare disk model, that were used to prove the geometry was consistent. Hyperbolic surfaces, or surfaces that can be used to model hyperbolic geometry, occur naturally in coral reefs and leaves (particularly lettuce, kale and the like). They also occur not-so-naturally in potato chips/crisps.</div><div>Phil: Neat! So, not all geometries are modeled on a coordinate plane. How about modeling on the surface of a sphere, such as on the surface of the Earth? In fact, how do you even define a line on a curved surface?</div><div>Clara: Well, the surface of the sphere is used to model spherical geometry, another type of non-Euclidean geometry. A line is defined to be the shortest path between two points (also known as a geodesic). In spherical geometry, these lines always lie on great circles, which are the circles on the surface of the sphere that have the same radius as the sphere itself.</div><div>Here's something fun: You may remember learning that in Euclidean geometry, the ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle is a constant, regardless of the size of the circle. This constant is called &quot;Pi&quot;. It turns out that this ratio is no longer constant on the surface of a sphere. </div><div>Phil: First I guess we need to be clear what we mean and define a circle on the sphere as the set of points equidistant to a fixed point, with distance measured as the shortest path on the surface.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_17da363ddaf342e3986a4e2e6a65d2a6~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Clara: Perfect. Here’s a visual of a sphere (say the surface of the Earth), with a circle labelled C outlining a &quot;polar cap&quot;, with its center at the north pole. This circle is at a latitude 30 degrees away from the north pole. The curve labeled R in the diagram is actually the distance on the sphere to the north pole.</div><div>Let's use the surface of the Earth as an example. We'll take the radius of the Earth to be 6,371km. Using trigonometry, we can work out that</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c3ac1231278142e590f559cb220aad44~mv2.png\"/><div>Since R lies on a great circle, it must be a fraction 30/360 of the circumference of a great circle, which works out to be approximately</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_67904c6858d941b5937106f75b4cd83f~mv2.png\"/><div>We can then easily calculate the ratio,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_fd78e98305524510a59742bdb64e1094~mv2.png\"/><div>Phil: Oh, so perhaps the readers can try it when the circle C is at a latitude 45 degrees away from the north pole, as in the following diagram:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_acaebaaa73f0421ba62b96c377b51e27~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Clara: Yes! In that case we get</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_20e88dbf784246c7b2a7eba23ce6378e~mv2.png\"/><div>You see, the ratio is not constant in this case, as it is on the plane. It is a different geometry. Can you reproduce this calculation? If you need help, check out this explanation by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/dangarbo10/featured\">dangarbo10</a>:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FC4q_D0al5M\"/><div>Phil: This is quite incredible that on the plane circles behave differently than on the surface of a sphere. I wonder what happens on a hyperbolic surface.</div><div>Clara: That's a great thing for our readers to explore! Another fun thing to research is real-life applications of non-Euclidean geometry. For example, check out <a href=\"http://www.drmarkliu.com/noneuclidean/\">Dr. Mark Liu's article</a> about print-making using hyperbolic and spherical geometry. </div><div>Did you have fun? <a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/contact\">Let us know</a>.</div></div>\n"

Some find it exciting, but many others get bored of it after a while. This is perhaps understandable. Is it really so exciting to memorize the fact that 7x8=56? Perhaps 9x9=81 is slightly more exciting, but not by much. </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_e9b518882fc54d528f4196b3e6b1b2e5~mv2.png\"/><div>But what if we were to investigate the numbers on the multiplication table like statisticians? Let's momentarily forget the mathematical structure of the table and just look at the data. This can even be done with young children.</div><div>Excel Fun: </div><div>List all the numbers 1,...,100. Then for each number, count the number of times it occurs in the table. For example, The number 12 occurs 4 times. The number 100 occurs only 1 time. The number 13 doesn't occur at all.</div><div>One way in which you can do this is create a column in Excel of the numbers 1,...,100. Then in a column next to it, fill in the occurrences manually. Show the multiplication table to a youngster and ask them to count how many 1's, how many 2's, how many 3's etc... Sit together next to the computer and fill it out together - believe it or not - kids think Excel is fun.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_cff2aa0a4807476d9ce80c8afe037221~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Plotting the count of occurrences for each of the numbers, you may generate a graph similar to this:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_2f05bed575ee4182b386fbbaf178c516~mv2.png\"/><div>As you see, all numbers between 1 and 100 occur either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 times. For example the number 80 occurs twice via 10x8 and 8x10. The number 81 occurs only once via 9x9. The Number 17 doesn't occur at all, and so forth.</div><div>Time for some insights:</div><div>There are 58 numbers that don't appear at all. Hence only 42 numbers appear. You can then carry out some inquisitive investigations: What is the smallest number that doesn't appear? What is the smallest even number that doesn't appear? Can a prime number appear on the multiplication table? How about a prime number greater than 10; can such a number appear?</div><div>There are 6 numbers that appear only once. For example 25, 81 and 100. What are the others?</div><div>There are 23 numbers that appear twice. Why is appearing twice so popular?</div><div>There are only 4 numbers that appear three times. For example, 9. What are the others?</div><div>There are 9 numbers that appear 4 times. What are those numbers? What makes them special? Does any number appear more than 4 times?</div><div>Here is a graph showing how many numbers occur 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 times:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_bd92a96edf7c4e849cfea46b6bff90ec~mv2.png\"/><div>Beyond the 10 Table: </div><div>But what if we didn't restrict our analysis to a multiplication table of size 10 by 10? For example, what if we considered the 11 by 11 table, the 12 by 12 table or even the 100 by 100 table? Can there be a number that appears more than 4 times on these bigger tables? Try for example the 12 times table, you'll see that there is a single number that appears 5 times and two numbers that appear 6 times. What are they?</div><div>And what if we were to venture to really big multiplication tables? Watch this little animation illustrating multiplication tables going from size 1 up to size 400. Each spot on the table is a pixel that is shaded based on how often the number appears on the table. Numbers that appear frequently are light blue and numbers that are rare are darker. Watch it a few times and ponder about some of the patterns that emerge. You can also pause the animation near the start to see the 10 by 10 table and make sense of the colors.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgbmDKfbeVw\"/><div>We enjoyed making this animation. Then after we watched it a few times, we were struck by this question:</div><div>What proportion of the numbers 1,...,n² appear on the n by n table?</div><div>That is, for the 10 by 10 table, 42 out of the 100 possible numbers appear, hence the proportion is 0.42. However, what happens to this proportion for bigger multiplication tables? What happens to this proportion as the size of the multiplication table grows? </div><div>For example, considering tables of increasing sizes (up to 400 by 400) and counting how many numbers appear on the table, we see that the proportion behaves as the graph below.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_f3adf9e80cd34291a0b5f9a9206b1438~mv2.png\"/><div>For reference, the right most point of the graph corresponds to the multiplication table based on multiplying the numbers 1,...,400. This table has 160,000 numbers in it. A computer program then shows that only 41,872 of these numbers appear on the table. Hence the proportion of numbers on the table is 0.2617; about a fourth. </div><div>We don't have answers to everything: </div><div>So what if we look at bigger and bigger tables? Would the proportion of numbers that appear flatten out at some quantity or would it get closer and closer to zero? We are actually not sure about the answer. </div><div>Our curiosity drove us to compute values of up to n=20,000. With thiswe reached the proportion 0.219846. However, based on such numerical investigation, we can't determine if the proportion will go to 0 as n grows, will reach some other limit, or perhaps behave in a more erratic manner.</div><div>Still, the numerical experimentation was fun and thought provoking. Now we are left with an unanswered problem. There is fun in that too.</div><div>Follow up (Updated a week later): After searching the Online Encylopedia of Integer Sequences we found out that the problem discussed above is known and solved. You can read more about it in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@yoni_26949/integers-sequences-in-the-footsteps-of-giants-d814bb668df1\">this post</a>.</div></div>\n"

However if you search for the opposite: &quot;<div>somebody remembers second place</div>&quot; you get about 1.3 million results! So is second place memorable or not? I guess it depends on who you ask.</div><div>Now when it comes to numbers, is there also a first and second place? Well I guess, you should define the competition. Here is one famous example:</div><div>Find a number, X, as small as possible, that can be expressed as the sum of two positive whole cubes in more than one way. </div><div>Try for example the number X=35. You can write</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_4b33cf8f744740eaa0713840c718a50e~mv2.png\"/><div>As you can see it is the sum of two cubes. So this is one way. The question is now if there are other numbers, a, b, (not 2 and 3) such that</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_4f77b9615d774b3fb636f267193f86ea~mv2.png\"/><div>Try as you might, you won't find such a and b. So the smallest X is clearly not 35. What is the smallest such X?</div><div>If you are a math enthusiast, or if you watched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Knew_Infinity_(film)\">The Man who Knew Infinity</a>, then you probably heard about the extraordinary Indian mathematician <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan\">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a>. In this clip from the movie, Ramanujan states that X = 1729 comes first. </div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qi4SDDjgHdU\"/><div>His friend and colleague, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy\">G. H. Hardy</a>, was not aware of such a &quot;competition&quot;. Later in historical notes, Hardy mentioned Ramanujan's observation about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)\">1729</a>:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_401d45bde6f0482688c70e496f167cd0~mv2.png\"/><div>Indeed Ramanujan was a remarkable man of numbers and mathematics. Few are the people who would recognise an arbitrary number like 1729 and make such an observation about it.</div><div>1729 comes in first place.</div><div>You may watch this neat <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSju5G2aFaWMqn-_0YBtq5A\">Standupmaths</a> video where Matt Parker tells us much more about Ramanujan's investigations:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_o0cIpLQApk\"/><div>So if 1729 comes first who comes second? Is there a second? A third? How would you compute that? The following image of a simple Excel spreadsheet does the job:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_2205dc218f064391bddd81f9e6af50eb~mv2_d_3016_1237_s_2.png\"/><div>You can download our <a href=\"https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/751ee7_3bdf2ff5146442ffa448ce78ca5099e4.xlsx?dn=1729_4104.xlsx\">example spreadsheet</a>, or you can try and create one of your own. It is nothing more than an &quot;addition table&quot; of the cubes 1, 8, 27, 64,... all the way up to 15625 (25 cubed). You can then inspect it visually and see that 1729 is the first such duplicate value. So who comes second? You got it: 4104. </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_99368ad67f29470b9d2dbb0e02c3a755~mv2.png\"/><div>Actually, when creating such a sheet, you don't have to visually inspect. You can also try to use Excel's conditional formatting and have Excel highlight duplicate values.</div><div>There is much more to discover about the sequence 1729, 4104, 13832,.... and related sequences. Some more information is in <a href=\"http://www.durangobill.com/Ramanujan.html\">this page</a>.

This new book, published by <a href=\"https://naturalmath.com/\">Natural Math</a> does a great job tickling the mathematical senses of the reader. </div><div>As we read the book with our children, we were fascinated by the story of Emmy and Leo, the main characters who find themselves in a magical world called Funville. The inhabitants of Funville each possess their own specific power. As Emmy and Leo meet more and more Funvillians, they are amazed by the different powers that each Funvillian exhibits, and begin to understand the fantastic things that can happen as a result.</div><div> In telling this story, the authors are in fact introducing the concept of a mathematical function. The characters themselves, or more specifically their special powers, can be viewed as functions. For instance, along the way we encounter characters who can rotate objects. In this way, readers meet examples of mathematical rotation functions. The Funvillians Rosalinda, Roberta, Robin and Roy are all able to rotate things, each at their own angle. For Rosalinda the angle is 180 degrees, and for Roberta it's 90. Then Robin and Roy can rotate objects through smaller angles as their special power (or function). Let your children think about it and express their ideas as you engage with them using this neat book. You might be surprised by what they say!</div><div>Other concepts relating to functions appear in the book as well. These include invertible and non-invertible functions, functionals (functions that can change functions) and periodic functions. No need to dwell on the math as you read. The math isn't even explicitly mentioned! Still, when the opportunity arises, stop and think, or better yet, discuss with your family. This book is superb for driving such exploratory engagement.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_e58ff2afd842494aa17ae13afa183ef7~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Throughout the book, the characters are presented with various problems that need solving. Problem solving in Funville is great fun, and we found that talking about their methods with our kids was an enriching experience. One great thing you could do as you read through the book with your kids is to propose problems of your own. For example, why not ask them if it would be possible for the Funvillians in the book to use their powers to fly?</div><div>Overall we found this book to be a very pleasurable and gentle read and we recommend that you give it a try too. It is a great initiative for introducing a rather abstract notion such as a mathematical function. Adventures in Funville is a captivating story, and you'll meet many Funvillians with curious powers. You may not realise it, but you will be thinking about mathematical ideas along the way.

In how many different ways can you show that the answer is (-2)? Have you ever used a number-line to show addition and/or subtraction? If we show (3) - (5) on a number-line, we would start at 3, but then how would we show subtraction? We may consider the idea of subtraction as “moving back”, “losing”, or “taking away”; in all those cases, we could say that subtraction means to move left of the original number.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_ae0cac2b5d7f475baab31631fa42714b~mv2.gif\"/><div>But, does the analogy of moving-to-left always work when subtracting numbers? Let’s consider another problem (-1) - (-3). How would we model this problem on a number line while continuing with the analogy of moving-to-the-left? In the visual below, we see that moving 3 numbers to left gives us a misleading answer: (-4). However, if we move 3 numbers to the right, we arrive at the correct answer: (2).</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c13555372eba4fc399fea0b975d5d05b~mv2.png\"/><div>You might already know with your prior knowledge that (-1) - (-3) = (-1) + 3 = 2 and not -4. In other words, we know that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding. But still, how do we explain that on a number line? How do we explain the change of the direction moving away from the original number?</div><div>Since the concept of direction doesn’t work very well in all examples, we could use a different explanation. For example, in our problem (-1) - (-3), we know that our starting position is (-1) and that after we are done with the subtraction, we should get another number on the number-line. However, to get the three negatives, we must take away the three negative intervals after (-1). Furthermore, if we go to the right of (-1), the interval between each consecutive number is negative 1; whereas, if we go to the left of (-1), the interval between each consecutive number is positive 1.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_cdf294ccef1e4d7aacbc61ce4a697d69~mv2.png\"/><div>Now that we have seen the concept of interval differences, we can demonstrate and evaluate the problem (-1) - (-3) on a number-line as follows:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_99e6da12d7e64888a36697fc8f1ee130~mv2.gif\"/><div>Using the visual of number-line for addition and subtraction gives us a new insight: </div><div>When adding or subtracting, we don’t add or subtract the numbers to the left or right of the starting number, but rather, we add or subtract the intervals between the numbers.</div><div>The great thing about concept of adding and subtracting intervals is that it is not limited to subtracting negative numbers only. We can apply this concept to the whole range of integers (positive and/or negative numbers). Let’s consider the example 5 - 3. Using the interval explanation, we could show the problem as:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_9e779509e1be43988a281dffbbec0b13~mv2.gif\"/><div>Using the number-line really helps us investigate more deeply about what it means to add and subtract numbers; however, that is not the only way to think about addition or subtraction. Do you have any strategies that help you think about a math concept differently?

What do you envision? Can you sense the energy that surrounds you? Or maybe you are reminiscing about the power feelings you get when cycling up a hill? Perhaps, you are thinking of something much more concrete - for example the power lines near your house, or maybe you are thinking of power struggles among people. How about the 1990 Snap top-hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BRv9wGf5pk\">I've got the power</a>, maybe that comes to mind? How about powers in mathematics?</div><div>Let's discuss power in mathematics. If we are dealing with a positive integer to the power of a positive integer, for example 2^5, it is read as &quot;<div>2 to the power 5</div>&quot;, which means 2 multiplied by itself, appearing 5 times. It is often written as, </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_736c130c09d1495b8bf20935bde2935d~mv2.png\"/><div>Is it understandable? Check your understanding. Can you calculate 3^2? Yes, it is 9. How about 4^3? It is 64,which is 4 x 4 x 4. Often, if you have something to the power 2, then it is called squared. If it is to the power 3, then it is cubed. These are just names of specific powers. So &quot;<div>3 squared is 9</div>&quot;, and &quot;<div>4 cubed is 64</div>&quot;.</div><div>There are other things to know about power. For example, what if you are taking something to the power of a fraction, or to the power of 0, or to the power of a negative number, or an <a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/single-post/2017/03/18/Is-i-More-Imaginary-than--1\">imaginary number</a>, or an <a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/single-post/2017/02/25/Get-Irrational-Impress-Your-Kids\">irrational number</a>? However, we won't go into all those details in this post. Instead, we want you to have a feel about the power of basic mathematical formulas, simple but powerful. We are going to explore some basic algebraic rules that are related to powers.</div><div>One way to give some power to your math</div><div>is understand the origin of rules.</div><div>For general rules, we have to work with variables rather than specific numbers. Like this one below, you know how to read it, don't you? It is &quot;<div>a to the power x</div>&quot;, written as: </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_aa95be6e03f34bbe948c69fae31f7faf~mv2.png\"/><div><div>Here the variable a is called the base and the variable x, is called the exponent. The exponent stands for the number of times that the base a appears. Although a and x represent variables, when you want a specific example, you can give them a</div>lmost any value. </div><div>With this in hand, consider the following: </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_a0887c05841a4c70940d8c32a75da694~mv2.png\"/><div>How would you read each of these expressions in words?</div><div>The first expression is read as 'a to the power x multiplied by a to the power y'. Can you figure out how many times does a appear?</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_faff611864c643488127aa5c414acb75~mv2.png\"/><div>All together, a appears x+y times. For example, 2^5 x 2^3 = 2^(5+3) = 2^8.We get the following rule: </div><div>The product of two powers with the same base </div><div>is the base to the power of the sum of the exponents. </div><div>The second expression is read as 'a to the power x, and then to the power y'. How many times does a appear?</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_2eb198576c754a6f8d7361078251accc~mv2.png\"/><div>As you can see, the number of times that a appears is the product of x and y. For example, (2^5) ^ 3 = 2^ (5x3) = 2^15. We get the following rule:</div><div>A power of a power is the base to the power of the product of the exponents.</div><div>The third expression is read as 'a to the power x multiplied by b to the power x'. How many times does a appear? It appears x times. How many times does b appear? It also appears x times. What can we do with that? </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_e77ddfd7d28f4ca3a3c2142e96782b2e~mv2_d_8242_3432_s_4_2.png\"/><div>For example, 2^3 x 3^3 = 6^3. We get the following rule: </div><div>The product of two powers with the same exponent is the product of the bases raised to the exponent.</div><div>The above rules together with a few others appear in this useful <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math\">Khan Academy</a> video:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kITJ6qH7jS0\"/><div>That was simple, wasn't it? Now try and close your eyes and whisper &quot;P O W E R&quot; again. Only this time do it very slowly. As you whisper, visualise the first rule, then the second and finally the third. You need to think a bit as you do it. Do you have the power? Try it a few times and you will.</div></div>\n"

Sure, but some people use it for technical work in fields such as finance, engineering, chemistry and architecture, just to name a few. Pretty much every field has some math applications. Math can be an incredibly useful tool. Is it a mistake, however, for us to think of math as only being a tool? We believe it is so much more. </div><div>In fact, math can be studied for its own sake. As <a href=\"https://www.math.hmc.edu/~benjamin/\">Arthur Benjamin</a>, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Math-Solving-Figuring-Out/dp/0465054722/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\">The Magic of Math: Solving for x and Figuring Out Why</a>, beautifully says, “Math is the science of finding patterns.” Those patterns could involve anything from numeric sequences to geometric relationships. For example, modular arithmetic, first developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss\">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>, is a type of arithmetic done on a number circle rather than a number line. Numbers reset to 0 upon reaching a certain fixed number. The classic example is arithmetic on a clock: when we get to 12, the count resets to 0. So, for example, on a clock, 10 o’clock plus 4 o’clock equals 2 o’clock. This is mod 12 arithmetic.</div><div>While modular arithmetic does have some wonderful properties, one of its major practical uses only came about in the 1970s when mathematicians used it in developing <a href=\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)\">RSA encryption</a> -- a method used to send and receive secure data like <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/the-rsa-algorithm-or-how-to-send-private-love-letters-13191\">private love letters</a>.</div><div>In a short ten minute <a href=\"http://www.numberphile.com/\">Numberphile</a> video <a href=\"http://singingbanana.com/\">James Grime</a> wonderfully explains how the RSA key works:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7kEpw1tn50\"/><div>If math is the science of finding patterns, then how do we actually find them? Well, there may be many avenues; here, let’s consider two popular themes: </div><div>1)Induction: we find a new or a unique rule that helps explain the pattern.</div><div>2)Deduction: we use other existing patterns to help uncover the new pattern. </div><div>In this blog, we will use the deductive method to help us solve the following puzzle:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_73aacd59be334da8b8242b11bea578f7~mv2.png\"/><div>In the above diagram, we have two primary shapes: a quarter circle with a radius, r, of length 6 inches, and a rectangle inscribed inside the quarter circle whose side lengths of x and y add up to 8 inches. The problem is to find the area of the white triangle.</div><div>To solve this problem, we can use our existing knowledge of these shapes (hint: deduction). Observe that the area of the white triangle is half the area of the rectangle with sides of length x and y as in the picture.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6f3912dcfa33473caae8724154b3df50~mv2.png\"/><div>Now, since the area of the whole rectangle is xy (that is, xmultiplied by y), the area of the white triangle is:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_fe0267603d4c4218998cc3f00f6b2abf~mv2.png\"/><div>Identifying the area formula is a really important step. What we need now is a way to calculate xy. Well, don't forget that the problem teases us with a clue: x + y = 8. Unfortunately, this equation alone is not enough to find xy. We need something else.</div><div>Actually, there is a very special pattern hidden in this picture. We know that when we are attempting to measure a missing side length of a right-angled triangle, we can use <a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/single-post/2017/05/13/Cut-corners-and-save-up-to-29\">Pythagoras' Theorem</a>:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_765244b7249a4c07a7ffecb58b51ef86~mv2.png\"/><div>Clearly, we can tell that the perpendicular side lengths a and b in the formula will be substituted by x and y, but what about c - the hypotenuse? Before you read on, give it a try on your own.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6a837123113840f0b6c4b88dbd32d1da~mv2_d_6024_5188_s_4_2.jpg\"/><div>Notice that the hypotenuse of the triangle we are interested in has the same length as the radius of the circle. Hence, c = 6. Using the Pythagoras' Theorem, we can then see:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_809122eb22ab48a5b8d7fa94c89528a3~mv2.png\"/><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_9d306cce4e5f448c98d27da3ffb12cef~mv2.png\"/><div>This might just be the extra something that we need! We now make an unexpected move that combines the given algebraic information x + y = 8 and the deduced Pythagorean equation: We take the square of x + y = 8. Let’s see:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_654cd931a57e418d8b16ba4355618305~mv2.png\"/><div>Notice that in the second to last step, we isolate xy. Also, in the last step, do you<div> see how Pythagoras' Theorem played a role in the substitution of x^2+ y^2? Additionally, every time we write &quot;</div>=&gt;&quot;, we read it as “which means that”, so it gives us a sequence of statements, each following on from the previous one.</div><div>Now that we have worked out the product of x and y, then the area of the white triangle is just:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_aafce629f3f74a8b94f3d5767d4542f6~mv2.png\"/><div>Reflection time: What do you think was the most difficult part of our working? </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_49980d67c62f4caab3fcc0c5396523c1~mv2.png\"/><div>Perhaps it was the point where we decided to take the square of the equationx + y = 8. What on earth made us decide to do that? It was because we had insight to deduce where that mathematical process would lead us. We knew that to complete this mathematical puzzle, we needed to find xy. We did it by using the information given, deducing new information (the Pythagorean equation) from the geometric patterns of the puzzle, and then putting it all together in a clever way.</div><div>Here's an open-ended question: Is there only one such triangle that will match the conditions given in the problem? In other words, what are all the values of x and y that would still give us an area of 7? </div><div>We appreciate <a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/contact\">feedback</a>! You may have also tried solving the problem differently. Do you have any insight from that? Did you explore your solution with your loved ones? We would love you to share your working with us. </div><div>With a little inspiration, curiosity and persistence, people of all different math comfort levels can make their own discoveries. In the link below, Arthur Benjamin, in his TED talk, “The Magic of Fibonacci Numbers” shares his inspiration. </div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SjSHVDfXHQ4\"/></div>\n"

It means that you can describe it to young curious minds and get them thinking about the current limits of human knowledge. When we present such problems to young souls, we often see yearning expressions and excitement. It isn't uncommon to see ambitious students wondering: “Will I ever do it?”. “Will it be done in my lifetime?”. &quot;Can it be done?&quot;.

Perhaps it is the fact that hardly any mathematical background is needed to understand the problem. For example, you may just need to know a thing or two about numbers. But before that, you need to understand the language used in a mathematical statement so that you can make sense of what the problem is actually asking. The language often involves these key words:</div><div>All, None and Forever. </div><div>What do we mean by this? Open problems often require you to prove or disprove one of the following types of statements:</div><div>All: A property holds in all cases.</div><div>None: There do not exist objects that satisfy a property.</div><div>Forever: A property appears in a repetitive pattern forever.</div><div>To get a feel for &quot;All, None and Forever&quot;, let's visit three very famous problems that seem simple even though they are extremely difficult to solve. Specifically, we will explore the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture\">Goldbach Conjecture</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem\">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime\">Twin Prime Conjecture</a>. We certainly won't go into the depth of the historical development of the problems, but rather get a feel of what they say. </div><div>If you know a little bit about number theory -- the study of whole numbers, you may say, &quot;Hey, I know Fermat's Last Theorem. It isn't open! It was actually solved and proved to be true!&quot;. Indeed you are right, a solution was provided by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles\">Andrew Wiles</a> in the 1990's after years of work and research effort. So why are we discussing it here?</div><div>The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem serves as an example of a problem that occupied attention of top mathematicians for centuries (ever since 1637). </div><div>It could only be resolved after an incredible amount of work that hundreds if not thousands of researchers, continuously and collectively developed.</div><div>The other two problems that we present are currently unresolved. Anyone who will solve solve them would be world famous. Will they be resolved in our lifetime? Maybe, but no one knows for sure.</div><div>Let's now see All, None and Forever in action through these three famous problems.</div><div>Goldbach Conjecture (All): Every positive even number, m, greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two prime numbers, p and q:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6ad3fef0d2b04aa4950c739fe4768c3d~mv2.png\"/><div>This states that if you have a positive even number, say 16, you can then write it as a sum of two prime numbers.</div><div>You may first ask: What is a prime number? A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that is not divisible by any other number except for 1 and itself. There are infinitely many of them, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19,... and this list goes on forever in a rather erratic manner.</div><div>You may then ask: How can I sum two prime numbers (p, q) and get 16 (m)? Try p=5 and q=11. There may even be other options. Do you see one?</div><div>It may seem easy if we choose one value for m, but the problem is that we need to find two primes, p and q, whose sum is m for all even numbers mnot just one. You can understand more about Goldbach's conjecture from this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile\">Numberphile</a> video: </div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxiTG96QOxw\"/><div>Fermat's Last Theorem (None): There do not exist positive whole numbers, a, b and c, that satisfy: </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_78ba6bb6d4a64227bab95f41019d822a~mv2.png\"/><div>where n is a positive whole number greater than 2. </div><div>You may associate Fermat's Last Theorem to something that you may be more familiar with --the <a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/single-post/2017/05/13/Cut-corners-and-save-up-to-29\">Pythagoras' Theorem</a>. Here is an example:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6b52733980874b1a84eb860e8adecff2~mv2.png\"/><div>The numbers (3, 4, 5) are called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple\">Pythagorean triple which satisfies</a> the top equation when n = 2. Some of us even know this by heart. But when you go on to n = 3, strangely as it may seem, you won't find any (a,b,c) triple of whole numbers that satisfies the equation. See this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile\">Numberphile</a> video for more:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNcEguuFSA\"/><div>Twin Prime Conjecture (Forever): There are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2 . In a mathematical equation, this can be represented as:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_b5c949773f2447f9ae2480313c405fdc~mv2.png\"/><div>where p and q are primes. Such primes are called twin primes. </div><div>Examples include the twins 5 and 7, the twins 59 and 61 or the twins 137 and 139. The conjecture (or belief) is that no matter how far we go down the number line, we'll find more and more twin primes. </div><div>Computers sometimes give insight into such problems. While, generally, computers can't provide proofs, they are used for numerical exploration. As of September 2016, the currently largest known twins are 2,996,863,034,895 · 2^1,290,000 ± 1. These numbers have 388,342 digits if they were to be written out! This is an impressive number, but it doesn't really tell us if the twin primes go forever or not.</div><div>This video by <a href=\"https://www.theglobalmathproject.org/\">James Tanton</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.theglobalmathproject.org/\">Global Math Project</a>, first explores the infinity of the primes and then builds up to the enigma of the twin primes. Do they go on forever?</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bq9mhjsQEPw\"/><div>There is so much to discover when you start thinking about mathematics. Sometimes, simple mathematical statements require so much effort to prove. Mathematicians around the world are continuously working on these open problems with passion and a full heart, hoping that one day, the secret will be unraveled.</div><div>Revolutionary educators are also seeking ways to bring human intelligence together. <a href=\"https://www.theglobalmathproject.org/learn#\">The Global Math Project</a>, provides a platform where curious minds discuss math and spark ideas across the world.

But thinking about it more, I ask, what does &quot;love squared&quot; mean? </div><div>Basically I'm asking about the effect of squaring. Where does this term come from? I guess it is based on the assumption that the strength of love can be measured by a single variable, say L. So if for example L = 7 then by squaring L we get much more love because L^2 = L x L = 49.</div><div>As you probably know, the square of a number is obtained by multiplying it by itself. You start with a side of length L and the area of the squareis L x L. So if the love I start with is a line of length L = 7. Then love squared is a square of area 49.</div><div>OK, I see what you may be thinking. You probably believe that love comes in many ways and forms and it isn't a number. In particular, love is often without bounds. Hence the magnitude, length, strength or value of L does not exist. You know what? I agree. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love\">Love</a> is a very special thing and it really cannot be represented just by a single number. However, for the purpose of this exploration, please bear with me and assume there is some value L that summarises the strength of the love. The larger L is, the more love we have. So back to the key question.</div><div>Does love squared mean more love?</div><div>Try L = 3 and get L^2 = 9. More love.</div><div>Try L = 1.5 and get L^2 = 2.25. More love.</div><div>Hence for these values of L, squaring it makes love grow. But how about L = 1? What happens to the love? How about L = 0? As you see, for these two values squaring the number doesn't do anything. Hence,</div><div>Love squared is sometimes more love, but not always.</div><div>So as we see, L^2 &gt; L for L = 1.5, 3 and 7. We also see that L^2 = L for L = 0 and L = 1. You may now ask: Are there any values of L for which L^2 &lt; L. That is, </div><div>Is there ever a case where love squared is less love?</div><div>Think about it yourself for a bit.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_2d343b0c67dc4fa7b24553efb56acfbd~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Well, how about L = 0.5. What is L^2? My nine year old daughter and I were discussing &quot;a half times a half&quot; the other day. You clearly know it is a quarter (0.25). But how? One way is to think of L^2 as a half of a half. For example, a half of half a dollar, is half of 50 cents which is 25 cents. Then that is a quarter of a dollar. </div><div>So we discovered that for L = 0.5 we get L^2 = 0.25. Less love!</div><div>Try a few other cases where L is a value between 0 and 1. For example if L = 0.3 then L^2 = 0.09. You are probably now tempted to conclude the following:</div><div>When 0 &lt; L &lt; 1 then L^2 &lt; L. That is, a proper fraction of love squared is less love.</div><div>And what if L was negative? How do you actually interpret negative love? Maybe it is &quot;hate&quot;? At this point it may be nice to recall the basic rules of multiplying positives and negatives together. Basically a negative times a negative is positive. But if the numbers have opposing signs -- that is, one is positive and the other is negative -- then the result is negative. One of my favourite resources for this is this lovely <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij-EK-MZv2Q\">video</a> from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg\">Mathologer</a>. But you can also look at this neat <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/multiplying-negatives.html\">page</a> by Math is Fun.</div><div>Now going back to our love squared world, take for example L = -4 then L^2=16, because it is a negative times a negative. Perhaps metaphorically you can say,</div><div>Squaring hate (L &lt; 0) makes love (L^2 &gt; 0).</div><div>Our exploration from above can now be summarized:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c4c066d17e3f46b5b9b0cf7b734b098f~mv2.png\"/><div>Wow, that is quite a lot to take in and we just did it by experimentation. Can we obtain this conclusion in a more structured manner and be sure about it? You see, often with mathematical exploration you start with experimentation and examples and then move onto a more organized analysis. </div><div>Let's do it. But for the path we'll take, we need a bit of basic algebra, common sense and the multiplication rules of positives and negatives mentioned above. </div><div>Keep in mind that we are interested in comparing, love squared (L^2) and love (L). Let's then write the difference between the two:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c44668d4dba4421aa163c1f2934d9b70~mv2.png\"/><div>If this difference is positive then it means that L^2 &gt; L. And if it is negative then L^2 &lt; L. And when L^2 - L = 0, it just means that love squared equals love.</div><div><div>Now let's manipulate the difference just a bit. Let's factor</div> out an L and get.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_0d46e299ba2a4a249404153e7dff092c~mv2.png\"/><div>If you now take a few minutes to let it sink, you'll see that this way of writing the difference gives us so much because it exactly shows us when L^2 - L is positive, negative or zero. By writing L^2 - L as L(L-1) we can treat it as a product of two numbers, L, and L-1. Let's now consider the three possible outcomes of love vs. love squared: </div><div>Q: When is L(L-1) = 0? This asks when is L^2 = L. </div><div>A: Only when L=0 or L =1. To get a product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of them has to be 0.</div><div>Q: When is L(L-1) &gt; 0? This asks when L^2 &gt; L.</div><div>A: Now using the multiplication rules mentioned above, we see that both L and L-1 need to have the same sign (either both positive or both negative). This happens when either L &lt; 0 (both are negative) or L &gt; 1 (both are positive).</div><div>Q: When is L(L-1) &lt; 0? This asks when is L^2 &lt; L.</div><div>A: Now the two factors need to have opposing signs. One needs to be positive and the other negative. Can you see why this happens for 0 &lt; L &lt; 1 and not for any other values of L? Work it through.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6ddd2518c4fc41e7957f877d2393dd74~mv2.jpg\"/><div>That is it, we got what we wanted, we understood the effect of squaring a number on its size. Continuing the love metaphor these were the rules that we found:</div><div>Square zero love or 1 unit of love and stay with the same amount of love.</div><div>Square negative love or true love (love &gt; 1) and get more love.</div><div>Square a proper fraction of love and get less love.</div><div>As I wrote this blog post, I couldn't help but think about the love in my life. I am lucky to have so much of it. Frankly, the metaphor of &quot;squaring love&quot; could only be extended so far. But nevertheless it got me thinking. Thinking about love, thinking about life. And thinking about the neat and simple math that compares L^2 and L. I'll be sure to share the latter with my loved ones when the right moment comes along.</div></div>\n"

Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.</div><div>What does imagination have to do with math? Well, Imagination is critical in aiding visualization of a problem, especially when there are multiple interrelated unknowns. Did you know that before Einstein mathematically developed his famous General Theory of Relativity, also popularly associated with the formula E = mc^2 , he first envisioned the problem as a mental experiment.</div><div>The video below from <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/show/nova/\">PBS NOVA</a><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/show/nova/\">provides an excellent illustration of Einstein's visualization of gravity, propelled by his imagination. It is an exciting hour long video, but the link below is for a clip from the 15th minute to the 18th minute.</a></div><iframe src=\"//static.usrfiles.com/html/19b9fe_0be206dc68a0f57ee035b3f5c9176f62.html\"/><div>Einstein is definitely an exceptional human being; however, the power of visualization is not only limited to exceptional individuals. Research has shown that students who are able to employ visualization strategies are more successful in both math and science than their peers who do not. In the book, <a href=\"https://www.youcubed.org/mathematical-mindsets/\">Mathematical Mindsets</a>, Jo Boaler of Stanford University provides great examples and benefits of visual thinking along with many activities to help motivate visual thinking about math. You may also consider visiting her web initiative, <a href=\"https://www.youcubed.org/\">youcubed</a>, which is full of strategies for teachers, parents, and students. In a nutshell:</div><div>The good news is that visualizing </div><div>complex problems can be learned.</div><div>But… only if visualizing could be done by talking about it. Let’s consider the following problem:</div><div>Kevin, Jill, and Elise are three cousins. Together they are 12 feet tall. Jill is one-half as tall as Kevin, and Elise and Jill together are five-sixths as tall as Kevin. Then, how tall is Elise?</div><div>If you feel comfortable with elementary Algebra, your instinct might be to set up this problem as a system of equations. Instead, entertain this problem using your basic number sense and visual representations. How would you solve it without algebraic procedures?</div><div>The key challenge in solving any problem</div><div>is first understanding the question.</div><div>The problem is asking to find out Elise’s height. The challenge is that the problem doesn’t specifically say anything about Elise’s height. In fact, upon closer inspection, you may realize that to decipher Elise’s height you would have to also find out Jill’s height, whose height is then only solvable with reference to Kevin’s height. Essentially, this problem has three parts: finding out Kevin, Jill, and Elise’s heights.</div><div>To visualize this problem, you may use a tape-diagram. This is often a great tool for solving problems involving interrelated parts. To start, draw a simple tape for Kevin. Start with his height because his cousins' height is based on his height. He is your 'target.'</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_a7497c66630d4bf8bc3c45932cccb665~mv2.png\"/><div>Now that you have created a tape for Kevin, you need a method to compare Kevin, Jill and Elise. You know that:</div><div>Jill is one-half as tall as Kevin.</div><div>Elise and Jill together as five-sixths of Kevin.</div><div>You can compare all three by converting their ratios into a common denominator, which in this case would be 6. Since Kevin's tape is the original whole, you may split his tape into six-sixths or one whole.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_099f4412201d454b85dcdce687ded627~mv2.png\"/><div>But if Kevin is six-sixths, how would you draw the tapes for 'Jill,' and 'Elise and Jill?' </div><div>Before you read on any further, attempt to complete the diagram on your own.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/349757f6ec5e450f88f625641e5055b1.jpg\"/><div>Compare your diagram with the one below. Does your diagram look similar to this?</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_105b93d2fb33456cb13b7fca62dbc7e3~mv2.png\"/><div>By converting all three cousins’ heights into sixths and representing them visually, you can now see that if Kevin represented six-sixths and Jill represented three-sixths of Kevin, then Elise must be two-sixths of Kevin. Together, they would represent eleven-sixths of Kevin's height. You can also check this by adding the first line (Kevin's) and the third line (Elise and Jill's) of the tape diagram together. You should get eleven-sixths. </div><div>To find out Elise's height, you would have to first divide 12 feet into 11 equal parts, which would gives approximately 1.09 feet for each one-sixth part of Kevin's height. Visually, this can be represented as: </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_d1fe9f4debdf4b18a1ab35dde3934085~mv2.png\"/><div>Now, all you have to do is add up the respective parts for each cousin to find their total height? What do you get?</div><div>Kevin is approximately 6.55 feet.</div><div>Jill is approximately 3.27 feet.</div><div>Elise is approximately 2.18 feet.</div><div>If you add the individual height of the three cousins together, what should it equal to? Also, above I mentioned that &quot;eleven-sixths of Kevin's height equals the whole.&quot; Now that we know Kevin's height, we can check if this statement is true: 11/6 x 6.55 feet = 12 feet. Isn't that the total height of all three tapes?</div><div>While many countries use centimeter and meter units for height measurement, some countries also use the foot (ft) and the inch (in) units. The challenge with measuring in feet and inches is not to mistakenly evaluate the decimal as inches. To further simplify the decimals into inches, a unit conversion is needed. Specifically, 1ft = 12in. For example, for Kevin's height, you can calculate the remaining inches by: 6ft + (0.55 x 12in) = 6ft and 6.6in. By following the same rule for all of the cousins, we get:</div><div>Kevin is approximately 6 feet 7 inches.</div><div>Jill is approximately 3 feet 3 inches.</div><div>Elise is approximately 2 feet 2 inches.</div><div>Any creative exercise requires a fair deal of imagination. Before solving a problem, it is very important to understand the problem. Once you are comfortable with the question, you may let your imagination and visualization fly; then, you can employ your numerical calculations and manipulations to decipher the answer. </div><div>If you still need some motivation to use your math imagination, you may enjoy James Tanton's <a href=\"https://www.theglobalmathproject.org/\">Exploding Dots</a>.

They started talking about mathematics, curiosity and education. Quite quickly they got onto the subject of children and teenagers. Yoni is the father of three children and Coco interacts with dozens of teenagers as a school teacher.</div><div>Yoni mentioned that his eldest daughter is going on a school trip to Australia's capital, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra\">Canberra</a>. It's her first time being away from home for several days. Yoni sounded a bit anxious, but mainly proud of his daughter. Just yesterday she was his baby, and now she has grown up so fast to become an engaging and curious young person.</div><div>Without noticing, Coco and Yoni's conversation moved onto math...</div><div>Coco: So, does it really feel like your daughter grows fast? How does that happen? If you were to consider one attribute such as her height, how fast do you think her height increases? </div><div>Yoni: At this point in life, I reckon my daughter's height increases by about 5% every year. I haven't looked deeply into it, but if you ask me, that would be my guess. Actually, I wonder, </div><div>If her height increases by 5% each year, does that mean that over a period of 2 years, it would increase by 10%? </div><div>Coco: Well, yes and no. If you say the growth in height is roughly5% per year, you can say that over a two-year period the growth in height is roughly 10%. However, if you say that the growth rate is exactly 5% per year, then your calculation is not that accurate. You are actually off by a quarter of a percent.</div><div>Yoni: Really? How come? Tell me more.</div><div>Coco: Why don't you do the calculation yourself? I will assist you. Let's say your daughter is 1 meter tall now, that is 100 centimeters (about 3 ft 3 in). If her height increases by exactly5% each year, how tall will she be in a year's time?</div><div>Yoni: I think she will be 105 centimeters tall, right? I know that,</div><div>Current height + Height growth in a year = Height next year</div><div>In an equation, it should be,</div><div>100 + 100 x 5% = 100 x (1 + 0.05) = 100 x 1.05 = 105</div><div>Coco: Yes, you are right. But you know what? You just discovered that multiplying the current height by 1.05 gives you the height in a year with 5% growth. The number 1.05 is called the growth factor.</div><div>Yoni: Oh, I see. Similar computations occur in finance and investment, right? For example, if I deposit $1,000 in the bank with 5% interest rate per year, then by next year I will have 1000 x 1.05 = $1,050.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6a837123113840f0b6c4b88dbd32d1da~mv2_d_6024_5188_s_4_2.jpg\"/><div>Coco: Exactly. Do you want to know your daughter's height in two years? </div><div>Yoni: Since you reminded me the meaning of multiplying by the growth factor 1.05, I just need to multiply by it twice. So it is:</div><div> 100 x 1.05 x 1.05 or 100 x 1.05^2 (squared)</div><div>Let me calculate. Oh, it is 110.25 centimeters. </div><div>Coco: Yes, 110.25 should be her height in two years but your initial guess wasn't exactly this. It is off by aquarter of a percent.</div><div>Yoni: So, at the beginning I guessed her height grows by 10% in two years, which should be 110 centimeters. The difference between the accurate calculation and my estimation is 0.25 centimeters. That is indeed aquarter of a percent of her original height. How did you know that this was the error from the start?</div><div>Coco: It is all related to this equation:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_e853397f99e14b8eac3117e8639d93f9~mv2.png\"/><div>Yoni: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Coco. Hold on! What do you mean? What is that symbol?</div><div>Coco: That is Epsilon, just like in One on Epsilon:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_2cfb750275a1479db28e27088c2af4ef~mv2.png\"/><div>Take Epsilon = 0.05. In this case the growth factor is 1.05, and over two years it is 1.05^2, which can be written as (1 + 0.05)^2.</div><div>Yoni: Still, I don't understand the equation. Where does it come from? Why is it needed?</div><div>Coco: Let me first answer your first question. The equation comes from this algebraic identity: </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_3b47f6d70f744c22a7e39fa15c9cde17~mv2.png\"/><div>where a = 1 and b = Epsilon. Now to answer your second question. Keep in mind that Epsilon = 0.05 and this is small compared to 1.</div><div>Yoni: So?</div><div>Coco: Notice that a small number squared gets even smaller. In this case, Epsilon^2 = 0.05^2 = 0.0025. That is our quarter of a percent. Hence to approximate, you can neglect Epsilon^2 from the first equation and get:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_f24a963579c54702a02e16fb419f53b9~mv2.png\"/><div>Yoni: Oh, I see. That is why you were saying I was off by a quarter of a percent because Epsilon^2 was neglected in my original estimation. Can we now explore the algebra of it? Can you describe more, Coco?</div><div>Coco: Consider the (a+b)^2 formula from above, where does it come from? </div><div>It comes from the expansion of brackets and distributive law, like this:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_413234c3a8e140019fa4a22a1ea637a5~mv2.png\"/><div>If you want to revise your knowledge on expanding brackets and how to use the distributive law, watch this neat <a href=\"http://www.mathantics.com/\">Mathantics</a> video:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v-6MShC82ow\"/><div>Another way to understand this formula is to consider a geometric representation. Imagine we have a square of side length (a+b),then (a+b)^2 is the total area of this square.</div><div>In our example using the height of Yoni's daughter, a = 1 and b = Epsilon = 0.05. This square then has side length (1+Epsilon) or (1+0.05); hence area (1+0.05)^2. Now, break this square into four parts like this:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_7347136852fe49cb8fbb9e7ee16f8574~mv2.png\"/><div>Can you pick out the individual parts from the formula?</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_e853397f99e14b8eac3117e8639d93f9~mv2.png\"/><div>The gray square region has side length 1 and hence area 1. Each of the blue rectangular region has side lengths 0.05 and 1; hence area 0.05. Two of them make the area be 2 x 0.05. The red square region has side length 0.05. What is the area of this red square?</div><div>You guessed it. It is 0.0025,which is the &quot;quarter of a percent&quot;. The area of the red square region is very small compared to the area of the entire square, that's why you may neglect it if approximating.</div><div>Yoni: Whoa Coco, thank you! You know, when I was in my teenage years I was always intimidated by basic algebra. But now it seems so clean and useful to me. My father was actually always trying to help me with this stuff, but I somehow couldn't do it well. I guess I had to grow a bit in order to fall in love with mathematics.</div><div>Coco: I'm glad we could discuss, it would be fun to explore more another day. Perhaps I can leave you with a related problem today: If you were to invest $100 in something risky and first loose 5% and then gain 5%. How much money would you end up with? Do you believe you would end up having your $100 back, or loose a bit, or earn a bit? Hint: Consider &quot;growth factors&quot; of 0.95 and 1.05.</div></div>\n"

It is the main theme of the <a href=\"https://www.theglobalmathproject.org/\">Global Math Project</a> for 2017. If you haven't seen exploding dots yet, you must! You'll be blown away by the simplicity and elegance of this mathematical system. How is it related to machines though?</div><div>Exploding dots is an amazing math framework based on mathematical machines. </div><div>We'll get to exploding dots soon, but first lets think about this concept: mathematical machines. What is a mathematical machine? Here is one example:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6fb35f24df6545dbbbbff1cdcd7441e4~mv2.png\"/><div>This neat illustration taken from <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Burn_Math_Class.html?id=cB8ejgEACAAJ\">Jason Wilkes</a>'s book, <div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Burn-Math-Class-Reinvent-Mathematics/dp/0465053734\">Burn Math</a><a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/single-post/2017/01/20/Why-Burn-Math-Class\">Class</a></div>, depicts a mathematical function as a machine. It operates on inputs, and returns an output M(s). For this specific machine, throw in s=7 and get output M(s)=49. To test your understanding of this machine, consider this:</div><div>Can this &quot;times self&quot; machine produce negatives?</div><div>You may recall that a product of two numbers can be negative only if the numbers have opposite signs. This means that one of them is positive and the other is negative. Does this ever happen inside this machine? No.</div><div>Using machines to illustrate the concept of a function is a great pedagogical metaphor. You may now ask:</div><div>Are there other ways in which machines and mathematics play together?</div><div>Here are interactions that immediately come to mind:</div><div>Designing Machines with Math: Mathematics is often used to design, calibrate and optimize physical machines. Cars, computers and cranes are all products of intricate designs hinging on mathematical techniques. Such an engineering process is sometimes the bread and butter of a mechanical engineer or an electronics hardware engineer. Even <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/the-bicycle-problem-that-nearly-broke-mathematics-1.20281\">bicycle design</a> is based on mathematics. It all starts somewhere.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_77fbc7df1a67442ab11e596a8df9d931~mv2.jpg\"/><div>The Basic Machines of Math: Some machines are used in elementary mathematics. These include protractors, various types of rulers and of course the drawing compass. You can actually have much fun with a ruler and a drawing compass. Such simple machines can drive so much thought. See for example this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lm9EHhbJAY\">numberphile video</a> featuring Zsuzsanna Dancso.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_022131b3b782409cb35797259e8d6cfc~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Control Theory:There are also whole fields of applied mathematics that sprung from the invention of machines. For example the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor\">centrifugal governor</a> invented more than two centuries ago motivated the field of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory\">control theory</a>. It is an interdisciplinary field that combines mathematics and engineering, with a wide range of applications like airplane autopilots, space exploration and health care machines. I highly recommend a neat simple book on this topic: <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642034459\">Feedback and Control for Everyone</a>, by Pedro Albertos and Iven Mareels.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_5fc72f512f814ef2a1a5cbe64927058f~mv2.png\"/><div>Logic and Computer Science: Then you come to computers. Incredible machines, aren't they? The past century has witnessed the computing revolution. One of its fathers, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing\">Alan Turing</a>, invented a mathematical abstraction of a computer. This mathematical model is now called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine\">Turing Machine</a>. Some may say it is the most serious mathematical machine invented to date. See this incredible video by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtOfTheProblem\">Art of the Problem</a>:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ZS_zFg4w5k\"/><div>Cellular Automata: There are also other forms of mathematical machines. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\">cellular automata</a> have become very popular in recent years among artists, mathematicians and practitioners. Cellular automata allow &quot;life-like behaviours&quot; to be generated from a few simple mathematical rules. For example, see this neat animation:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M4cV0nCIZoc\"/><div>Machine Learning: This is all about making a computer carry out intelligent tasks by training it to &quot;think softly&quot;. Can a computer look at an image of an animal and decide if it is a cat or a dog? Machine learning helps. Watch this neat <a href=\"http://www.oxfordsparks.ox.ac.uk/\">Oxford Sparks</a> video:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f_uwKZIAeM0\"/><div>So as you see, there is a vast playground for machines and mathematics. </div><div>And now exploding dots!</div><div>Exploding dots is a neat conceptual framework for arithmetic, algebra and mathematical exploration. It allows you to feel mathematics in a visual and intuitive manner.</div><div>What aspects of math is exploding dots good for?</div><div>Exploding dots is great for understanding addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It is great for understanding base representation of numbers. You don't have to think base 10 all the time. It is great for understanding how long division works. But that is just the start.</div><div>What else can you do with exploding dots?</div><div>Exploding dots allows you to understand how to represent <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials.html\">polynomials</a> just like numbers. Yes polynomials, those objects encountered in algebra class. It even allows you to explore division of polynomials. You can even create fractions and make up certain irrational numbers. Exploding dots provides you with intuition for all these things. Watch this introduction by <a href=\"http://gdaymath.com/about/\">James Tanton</a>:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KWJVAjONqJM\"/><div>So how are machines related?</div><div>The basic building block in exploding dots is a machine. Common machines explored in exploding dots are the 2--&gt;1machine, the 10--&gt;1machine, or if you are into <a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/single-post/2017/02/10/The-Planet-of-Base-4\">base 4</a>, the 4--&gt;1machine. Then there are more abstract machines, for example the x--&gt;1machine that helps with exploring algebra and polynomials. In fact, you can explore any M--&gt;N machine that you wish.</div><div>How do these machines work?</div><div>The basic operation of the machines in exploding dots is simple.Consider for example the 2--&gt;1 machine as in the video below. The machine has cells that contain dots. But dots can be stable or not. Put more than two dots in a cell and &quot;Kaboom&quot;. They explode. The result is a single new dot born on the next consecutive cell for each explosion. That is it! The operation of the machine is very simple. Watch:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSQyctFGMxc\"/><div>So how can such a simple thing be used for mathematics?</div><div>Exactly! This is the beauty of exploding dots. It is a simple set of rules (mathematical machine) that allows you to carry out extremely powerful mathematics. Play around with the 2--&gt;1 machine, the 10--&gt;1 machine or the x--&gt;1 machine and you'll understand so many things better. See this collection of free <a href=\"http://gdaymath.com/courses/exploding-dots/\">great resources</a>.</div><div>There is so much more to say about exploding dots. There are many little and big lessons to be learned through the content of the global math project and the content of <a href=\"http://gdaymath.com/courses/exploding-dots/\">G'day Math</a> by <a href=\"http://gdaymath.com/about/\">James Tanton</a>. The nice thing about it all, is that <a href=\"https://www.theglobalmathproject.org/ambassadors\">hundreds of caring educators</a> around the globe have joined the global math project. You'll surely hear more from us at One on Epsilon about Exploding dots as we near the global math week.</div><div>The global math week takes place on October 10-17, 2017.</div><div>In the meanwhile, we recommend that you <a href=\"https://gmw.globalmathproject.org/#login\">register</a> with the global math project and prepare to be blown away by exploding dots. Join the movement.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_b72d9cd24dbf4fa5b84b59090a4fd1c6~mv2.png\"/></div>\n"

Shouldn't she have said &quot;99 cents&quot; instead? I started questioning her in my head while handing over a dollar.</div><div>Here in Australia, there aren't any 1 cent coins. So when I pay by cash, I actually have to pay a full dollar. However, when I pay by card, charging me the exact 99 cents is definitely doable. So why did the shopkeeper ask me for a dollar instead of being more precise? Is it because $0.99 is so close to a dollar that she just automatically rounded 0.99 to 1? Similarly, for an item that is priced $1.99, would I be charged $2 cash?</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_603ff55ba98a49aeb5cca79dc120fd18~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Having experienced this at the shop got me thinking about an interesting and related mathematical fact:</div><div>0.99999... = 1(when the digits go on forever)</div><div>You can see that in 0.99999..., the digits go on forever after the decimal point. We call this type of decimal representation of a number '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal\">recurring decimal</a>'. The question is how can I explain to my students that 0.99999... in fact equals to 1? Can I use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding\">rounding</a>?</div><div>Being a high school math teacher in Australia, I found that rounding is a necessary aspect of the maths curriculum. Students are expected to be fluent in rounding by the time they reach high school. If students know how to round, should I use rounding as a generalized explanation for other content? </div><div>For example, when I introduce the relation between 0.99999... and 1, wouldn't it be easy to just say &quot;<div>0.99999… can be treated as 1 because 0.99999 (without the ...) can be rounded to 1</div>&quot;. Notice here 0.99999... is a recurring decimal whereas 0.99999 (without the ...) is an exact value. Use rounding, we can say that &quot;0.99999 can be rounded to 1&quot; or &quot;0.99999 is approximately 1&quot;. </div><div>Is this an acceptable explanation?</div><div>If having a university mathematics degree means being trained to be precise, I certainly have carried on this habit into my teaching career. When I am teaching, I always try to see myself through the eyes of my university professors and try to speak the correct mathematical language. Would they approve of &quot;0.99999… can be treated as 1 because 0.99999 (without the ...) can be rounded to 1&quot;? Or is there a sharper explanation?</div><div>As a maths loving person, I believe that there is always a pursuit of better and sharper explanations for a question. In the following, I am going to try to convince you that 0.99999... = 1 in more rigorous ways. Here is what I can do.</div><div>First, we know that 1 divided by 3 can be represented as both a fraction and a recurring decimal, shown below:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_125446bffedd4a1980cd3e13a5760a26~mv2.png\"/><div>We also know that when we have an equation, we can apply the same operations on both sides and obtain a new equation. Here if we multiply both sides of the equation by 3, we get:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_af7feaf5eee04a60b934803f12046057~mv2.png\"/><div>This is what we want, isn't it? </div><div>Well it is, if you accept playing around with the forms used to represent numbers. The trick here is to view the fraction 1/3 as a recurring decimal, 0.33333.... And then to accept that multiplying this recurring decimal by 3 gives us another recurring decimal, 0.99999....</div><div>However, what if you don't wish to represent 1/3 as a recurring decimal? Let me show you an alternative way that doesn't involve fractions. For the fun, let's use a slightly different example, proving 1.99999... = 2. Here is what I can do:</div><div>First, let X be the recurring decimal:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_a3a24d48bddd4535b7240206feb33d0b~mv2.png\"/><div>So,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_49b2ef3fedd948409db3b5ac57a7e8fd~mv2.png\"/><div>Did you notice that both X and 10X have the same repeating digits after the decimal point? Why? Because when we multiply 1.99999... by 10, we move the decimal point of 1.99999... to the right by one position, and end up having 19.99999....</div><div>Now that we have two equations, we can merge them into a single equation. In this case, let's subtract the first equation from the second. This gives us,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_ff96ce9d6d4e4865a37f58f62dbe6460~mv2.png\"/><div>Therefore, </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_091256c20cfc467e8a07e02d6b6a121d~mv2.png\"/><div>Now solving for X, we get:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_8d9a9e63c8824908a032d377d710e416~mv2.png\"/><div>So we started with X=1.99999... and ended up with X=2. Therefore, it must be that,</div><div>1.99999... = 2</div><div>This method is a neat way to prove 1.99999...=2 for those of you who don't believe 1/3 can be represented as 0.33333....</div><div>In fact, 1/3 and 0.33333... are indeed equivalent because 0.33333... can be written as the sum of an infinite <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series\">geometric series,</a> whose limit is 1/3. Let's leave geometric series for another day. But if you want to find out more, explore this video. Here Burkard Polster illustrates these concepts marvellously.</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDtFBSjNmm0\"/><div>Let's go back to the price tag of the water bottle. If I were not a teacher but working in the business profession, I could come up with ways to legitimately charge my customer $1 instead of $0.99.</div><div>How? I can just write the recurring decimal, $0.99999..., on my price tag.</div><div>However, this may seem a bit ridiculous to do as there are too many digits and dots on the tag.</div><div>But no worries, I know that 0.99999... can be written in simpler ways, such as:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_7c42f138707740c1bedf170f35a7b282~mv2.png\"/><div>These forms are the most commonly used representations of recurring decimals. You can choose to place either a line or a dot over the digit where it starts to repeat. Probably, if I rewrite the price tag in the shop like this below, customers will never question the precision of the money they get charged again.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_565612c6f94b49d4ba51de611691731c~mv2.jpg\"/></div>\n"

So, all ten of you decide to share the cost; but then, how do you share the cost? Surely, there is more than one way to split the bill. Whenever there is more than way to do something, you may estimate. </div><div>Estimating is not easy; in fact, statisticians dedicate their entire lives to this. It isn't easy to figure out methods for estimating answers to problems whose answers aren't clearly defined. </div><div>While some methods of estimation are very advanced, others like the arithmetic mean and the median are mathematically simple. These methods often provide very good estimations of the central tendency. This means they help to figure out what is happening in the middle of your data (observations). In case of an arithmetic mean, you give each observation an equal weight. In your case, this implies that each friend shares the cost equally. </div><div>To find the arithmetic mean, you take all the observations and add them up. In you and your friends' case, that would be the total bill: $319. Then, you divide it equally among each of the ten friends:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_3657b491e1bb4eb8b6bfc8759fda6f2d~mv2.png\"/><div>Consider this plot showing the arithmetic mean in orange and the cost of each person in blue:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6c3a8db272944767bc89e9e8cacb6dca~mv2.png\"/><div>What do you notice? If everybody paid the mean value of $31.9, would that be fair to everybody? From the data, you see that 7 out of the 10 friends spent less than the mean. Should an estimate be considered fair if 3 friends benefit from sharing while 7 friends are paying more than their cost of the meal?</div><div>So you try something else. Instead of dividing the cost equally among each friend (using the mean), you consider using the middle number. This is called the median. Since you will look at the middle number, it only makes sense to first arrange your costs from the lowest to highest. Then, you would cross off each number from the furthest ends until we reach the middle. However, in your example, there are two numbers in the middle (see below) so you take a value in the middle of the middle two numbers. The middle of $20 and $22 is $21. That is the median.</div><iframe src=\"//static.usrfiles.com/html/19b9fe_45623263866fa9a44dd5187bb49babe8.html\"/><div>Now this plot shows the median in grey and the cost of each person in blue:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6254741d6a5f4e9f896a2544036052cd~mv2.png\"/><div>Walla! I think you might have found a good estimate of the central tendency. In the graph, you notice that $21 does a very good job at estimating the central tendency. This seems fair since half of your group benefit by paying less, and the other half ends up paying a bit more than what they ordered. </div><div>But only if the job of a statistician was that simple! If you and your friends chose the median as the best estimate, you would come short $109 from the total bill because you would only be able to pay $21 x 10 = $210. Opting the median as the best estimator might make all the friends happy; though unfortunately, it won’t help pay the restaurant bill. So in summary:</div><div>The median may seem like a robust estimate of the cost,</div><div>but don't count on it for splitting bills.</div><div>Back to the arithmetic mean; why does it do a poor job at estimating fairly in our example? Put differently, how would a statistician know when an arithmetic mean does a poor job at estimation? In your example, the mean is effected greatly because Hannah’s meal cost the most. At $120, she spent about three times as much as Jennifer, who spent the next highest amount ($38). For example, if Hannah’s meal was to cost $40, the mean cost would be $23.9 which is very close to median: $21. </div><div>Unfortunately for you and your friends, Hannah’s meal doesn’t cost $40 but rather $120. Statisticians refer to Hannah's meal as an outlier, which is a number located far away from the bulk of the observations. It could be either very high or very low in comparison to the rest. At your dinner table, Hannah’s meal costs way more than any of the friends. Large outliers often cause over or under estimation of the central tendency by influencing the arithmetic mean. This is one of the reasons that statisticians sometimes don't use the mean as an estimator and instead use the median.</div><div>Food for Thought: After the dinner, Thomas, Azam, you, Ebby, and Wassim were a little unhappy about splitting the bill equally. You didn't like how far off the mean was from the value of your own meal. The five of you agree that a fair estimate for the bill would be around $25. Since Hannah's meal was the most expensive, you wonder: what is the most Hannah could have spent, so that mean would not be more than $25?</div><div>To help you find the answer, you may find this formula helpful:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_44d0b8354d214b22a8d8bb3821d8f638~mv2.png\"/><div>Good luck!</div></div>\n"

You may try to maximize profit or yield, minimize time or effort, maximize enjoyment, minimize pain, maximize the chance of getting the right prediction, minimize the number of attempts at taking a shot,... the list goes on and on.</div><div>Is this how you think about optimization? Maybe sometimes?</div><div>There is a slightly different view as well: Say you are a software engineer. In this case, you probably use the word optimization for describing the process of improving your product. For example as you start creating it, your computer program or application may run in a slow and inefficient manner. This means that the user has to wait for output or maybe the program uses a lot of battery power and network resources.</div><div>As you improve your app, you use creative means to make it more efficient. It will then run faster, use less battery power, less network resources and perhaps be more responsive to user input. In such a process, there isn't necessarily a well defined numerical objective. Nevertheless, it is called 'optimization' and the act of making incremental improvements to your product is called `optimizing'.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_5f4c07dfe0bd4970b1961a218f13a76a~mv2.jpg\"/><div>But let us focus on optimization where there is a clear quantity you want to improve. Something you can measure. Time, distance, monetary expenses, weight, profit, score, fuel consumption or in general, a number that you either call `value' if you are trying to maximize, or 'cost' if you are trying to minimize. Think of some more examples from your day to day life. Now ask - how does mathematics fit in?</div><div>Before we explore a simple and concise mathematical way of grasping optimization, let's see a few more examples. You see, optimization is not necessarily operational. By this I mean that when you carry out optimization, the result doesn't always influence your choice, action or behaviour. For example at your current geographical location, how long is the longest day of the year and what is that day? How about the shortest day?</div><div>This is clearly not operational. No one has yet been able to influence the length of days. Luckily, the spin of the earth and our movement around the sun are beyond our control. Nevertheless, as an optimization question, it is very legitimate: When is the longest day? </div><div>Answer: If you are in the northern hemisphere then it is at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_solstice\">June solstice</a>, and for us on the south side, it occurs at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_solstice\">December solstice</a>. The actual length of that day depends on the exact location on the globe.</div><div>Or here is another example. Say you are playing Monopoly. On each turn you toss a pair of 6 sided dice and add up their numbers to see how many steps your player needs to move. What is the most likely number of steps?</div><div>Answer:7. You can get an intuition for this by seeing that getting a sum (number of steps) such as 2 or 12 can occur only with a specific result (1 + 1 for 2 and 6 + 6 for 12). That is, getting either 2 or 12 isn't likely. But getting 7 can occur in more ways: 1 + 6, 2 + 5, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 5 + 2, and 6 + 1. So it is more likely and if you think about it a bit more, you'll see it is the most likely outcome. </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c8148caea2494e0c8d331e4ebf644a36~mv2.jpg\"/><div>As another example, say you have a 1 meter long string. What shape can you create so as to maximize area?</div><div>Can you visualise this? Maybe grab some string, or draw a few shapes. Notice that all shapes will have a perimeter (called circumference when the shape is curved) of 1. But the area of the shape will vary.</div><div>Hint: The maximal area is 1/(4 pi). What shape with a perimeter (circumference) of 1 has such an area? You can probably take a guess.</div><div>So you see, sometimes optimization is a means for deciding what to operationally do as in the navigation, farming and sporting examples. At other times, optimization is just about answering a maximization or minimization problem. This is a subtle distinction, but it just comes to show that there are different ways for thinking about optimization.</div><div>It is sort of like the difference of asking: </div><div>&quot;Where is the highest point in Ireland?&quot; </div><div>as opposed to, </div><div><div>&quot;Where should I go in Ireland to be highest?&quot;</div>.</div><div>In both cases the answer is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrauntoohil\">Carranutoohil</a>, a peak at 1,038 meters above sea level (3,406 ft). I have never climbed it. But cycling near it, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Kerry\">the Ring of Kerry</a>, was an incredible experience. Believe me, Ireland is mystically beautiful.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_016714baeeb84e8ab204a9c70f451948~mv2.jpg\"/><div>So how can we view optimization mathematically? </div><div>The common way to do this is to think in terms of a function. As an example, consider <a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/single-post/2017/05/13/Cut-corners-and-save-up-to-29\">last week's blog post dealing with triangles</a>. In that context, we encountered,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_8536f0312ed04f0cacdcc851f61d2cb8~mv2.png\"/><div>Such a mathematical expression may look intimidating, but don't fret over it. It is a function of the variable x. The function is called &quot;f&quot;. When you give the function a value of x, you get in return f(x). Take for example x = 0. This means to replace x by 0, everywhere in the equation above. Keeping in mind that the <a href=\"https://www.squarerootmarbles.com/\">square root</a> of 1 is 1, we get f(0) = 0. Can you see this? </div><div>Or as we showed in last week's blog post, if x = 1 then y = 0.295 (approximately). And this is actually the maximum of the function. Here is a plot of the values of f(x) for x in the interval [0,10].</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c824bf161395426b918a02484550ca5c~mv2.png\"/><div>So in general, what is a function?</div><div>A function is a machine that transforms an input x to an output y. </div><div>This can be written as</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_3ceb7dc5898a4cf68296bc194f7ebbdc~mv2.png\"/><div>But where do functions appear in the many optimization examples discussed above?</div><div>When considering general optimization problems we let x be in a domain of values that isn't necessarily composed of numbers. For example, x can be a route you take in your neighbourhood, a trajectory of a baseball bat, a shape made by a string of length 1 or a location in Ireland. The domain, exactly specifies that set of allowed values and depends on the problem at hand.</div><div>Consider for example my children's cats: &quot;Booboo&quot;, &quot;Lily&quot;, &quot;Grey&quot;. Say we are interested in the (simple) optimization problem of finding the heaviest cat. For this, let f(x) be the function that takes x as the cat and specifies the cat's weight in kilograms. In this case the domain is </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_66265610fa024d298bdc36e1493b250b~mv2.png\"/><div>What would then be the function? Is there a formula for it? No, in this case we don't have a formula for the function. We rather write a table:</div><iframe src=\"//static.usrfiles.com/html/19b9fe_9a0b5ad94f73958308488168de8b8171.html\"/><div>In fact, you can always view a function as a table. Note though, that when the domain is infinite, you need a very long table, an infinite table. Keep in mind, that having a formula is a luxury, it is actually an exception as opposed to the rule.</div><div>How about the output value y? Can it also be anything or does it need to be numerical? Well, here, since we are using functions for optimization, we want to be considering real functions. This is a function that has a real number as an output. After all, when you optimize, you treat the output as 'value' or a 'cost'. In a fancy mathematical way you can introduce a function like this: </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_bf2475472e694c12a53f54021b181a04~mv2.png\"/><div>Here the curly looking D, is the domain of the function. Then the impressive looking R is the set of all real numbers. This is called the range of the function. So real functions are functions whose range is the set of real numbers. </div><div>Wow! Fancy notation. How would you then describe an optimization problem? Say a maximization problem? Well just write,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_ca307b6fb7d141adaf2223520ac88b0e~mv2.png\"/><div>This mathematical notation states that y* is the maximal value obtained by the function over the whole domain. It implies to &quot;try&quot; f(x) for every x in D and choose the maximal value. In the case of my children's cats we have y* = 4.1.</div><div>Then there is also,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_ffe5d9b98d134c548b78cad5d6352abb~mv2.png\"/><div>This means that x* is the point that maximizes the function. In the case of my children's cat's we have, x* = &quot;Lily&quot;. In the case of the Ireland example we have x* = &quot;Carranutoohil&quot;. </div><div>So basically, when you come to a mathematical optimization problem, all you need, is f(x), a domain D, and then just search for x* and y*. However, you should keep in mind that for some problems, y* doesn't always exist and/or x* is not always unique.</div><div>So wow! With three simple formulas, optimization looks so simple and compact. Is it? Well, often finding a useful representation of the function f(x) is a hard mathematical modelling challenge. In operational problems, you want f(x) to describe reality well. This isn't always easy.</div><div>Further, even if a problem is represented correctly, understanding that there exists a y* and/or a unique x* can be a mathematical challenge. Finally, and most importantly, finding efficient ways for computing the pair (x*,y*) is a real challenge. In fact, some problems are known to be computational nightmares. Have you heard of the travelling salesman problem, for example? Let's keep that for another day.</div></div>\n"

T W E N T Y N I N E P E R C E N T!&quot;. He sounded angry. I guess he wasn't expecting me to quantify cutting corners. For him, the phrase `cutting corners' is associated with being hasty. In such cases, it often isn't clear how much you save. Indeed they say that `haste makes waste', so even if you save on work or materials, compromising quality can be damaging in the long run.</div><div>But I was not thinking of our joint work when I brought up my 29%. I rather had a pleasant picture such as this in mind:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_368deb7d76c84ce0a258f2a13b9c817c~mv2.jpg\"/><div>We see such corners in our school grounds, cities, parks and countryside. It is so often the case, that walking paths or roads intersect at right angles. When I walk, I always seek to `cut across'. Perhaps in a previous life I was a bird.</div><div>As a concrete illustration, see this Google Maps satellite image of a playing field in Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA: </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_071bea2fc2a14c7485f04e6c4376cee1~mv2.png\"/><div>Say you are at the southwest corner and wish to reach the northeast corner. According to Google, this distance of 0.5 miles, about 800 meters would take about 10 minutes to walk. But wouldn't it be better to cut across?</div><div>Walk in a north-east direction as opposed to first east and then north. This would save you about 29%, so you would walk for about 7 minutes instead of 10.</div><div>You may now ask where 29% comes from?</div><div>When you have a 90 degree corner, you have a triangle. A right triangle. Then when it comes to right triangles, you have one of the most celebrated elementary classic mathematical results of all times: The Pythagoras Theorem. See this short video:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CAkMUdeB06o\"/><div>Q: Is the yellow triangle in the video a right triangle?</div><div>A: Yes, it has a 90 degree angle. This means that the side opposing the right angle is called the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right triangle.</div><div>Q: The video shows that the quantity of liquid that fits in the square created by the hypotenuse is exactly the same as the quantity of liquid fitting in the sum of the other squares. How would you describe this in words?</div><div>A: This is the Pythagoras Theorem:</div><div>The square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the two sides.</div><div>Q: If we denote the lengths of the sides by A and B, and the length of the hypotenuse by C, how would we describe the relationship between A, B and C in an equation?</div><div>A: Here are a few alternatives:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_688fb66262134e4490e06b011aea8f27~mv2.png\"/><div>Or if you apply <a href=\"https://www.squarerootmarbles.com/\">square root</a> to both sides,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_5607ea85e96447aaaee37f4a7b628f44~mv2.png\"/><div>Or if you try to find A in terms of C and B,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c64f10614c034f819c7360170829a679~mv2.png\"/><div>So you see that you can represent C in terms of the other sides, or A in terms of the others sides. Try to see if you can find an expression for B in terms of C and A, it works just the same as the above. You can also try to see how the theorem works for typical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple\">Pythagorean triples</a>, such as the famous triple, A = 3, B = 4, C = 5 or A = 5, B = 12, C = 13.</div><div>Maybe even draw triangles of such dimensions (or proportional dimensions) with your kids. If you want to review it a bit, here is a useful <a href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/pythagoras.html\">elementary summary of Pythagoras by &quot;Math is Fun&quot;</a>. </div><div>So having reviewed Pythagoras, it is now a rather simple matter to see our 29%. For this we should first agree that a right triangle that is also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_triangle\">isosceles</a> maximizes the percent savings. Having such a triangle means we cut the corner at an angle of 45 degrees. </div><div>One way to see this is to design a function that measures our relative saving. For example,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_8536f0312ed04f0cacdcc851f61d2cb8~mv2.png\"/><div>This function considers a right triangle with A = 1 and B = x. What is then the length of the hypotenuse? Where do you see it in the function? The denominator is the distance we walk without cutting the corner. That is 1 + x. The numerator is then the distance we save by cutting.</div><div>We could have designed the function with other values for A as opposed to 1. But it doesn't really matter, the point is that when x=1,it holds that A=B. <div>Here is a plot of the function for x in the range of 0 to 10.</div></div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_c824bf161395426b918a02484550ca5c~mv2.png\"/><div>When x is either very small or very large, there is hardly a corner to cut and hence there isn't much saving, but when x = 1, we have a 45 degree angles in our triangle (it is an isosceles right triangle) and as you can see we save about 29%. The function f(x) indeed attains a maximum at x=1. This value is at,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_46c3d3ed5b58492aa9d595b378af67e4~mv2.png\"/><div>Indeed when dealing with such neat triangles, the square root of 2 always pops up. We discussed it when we surveyed other <a href=\"https://www.oneonepsilon.com/single-post/2017/02/25/Get-Irrational-Impress-Your-Kids\">irrational numbers</a>, and we'll surely explore it more in the future.</div><div>As I finished telling him about the origins of my 29% he looked at me with appreciation. &quot;Thank you for stopping our silly debate and reminding me how much I like geometry and mathematics&quot;, he said.</div><div>I smiled and thought to myself, &quot;what a nice thing of him to say&quot;. I was then reminded about how much I appreciate him. &quot;Why?&quot; I thought to myself. I pondered about it for a while and then came to a clear conclusion. I really appreciate him because he doesn't cut corners.</div></div>\n"

While solving such &quot;textbook&quot; problems may be fun, open problems are a completely different ball game. Solve one of those and enter the books of history!</div><div>There are tens of thousands of open mathematical problems touched by humans and still unsolved. In fact, as you are reading this, thousands of research mathematicians and enthusiasts around the globe are thinking about open problems. Some are loosing sleep over it too. To solve one, you need endurance, creativity, and sometimes a touch of genius. Nevertheless, you don't need to be a genius to enjoy mathematics. I'm talking from experience here.</div><div>For some famous open problems in mathematics, getting an understanding of the meaning of the problem is a formidable task in its own right. It requires knowledge of the definitions and terms that setup the problem and make it interesting. Sometimes to appreciate such problems, one needs to have solved similar simpler problems earlier. </div><div>For example, one of the greatest open problems of these days is the 160 year old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis\">Riemann Hypothesis</a>. Have a glance for example at this nice <a href=\"http://www.numberphile.com/\">numberphile</a> video featuring <a href=\"http://www.edwardfrenkel.com/\">Edward Frenkel</a>:</div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d6c6uIyieoo\"/><div>You probably follow the great exposition of Edward Frenkel just fine. However as the exposition continues, you may appreciate the fact that really understanding the details of the Riemann Hypothesis requires quite a bit of knowledge. This is at a level comparable to several university level mathematics courses.</div><div>University mathematics is great fun, but does one need to spend all this time learning mathematics before fully understanding famous unsolved problems? Certainly not! As I was recently reminded by <div><a href=\"https://blog.buzzmath.com/2016/12/21/2308/\">Sunil</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmgeUjq0cPM&amp;t=2s\"></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmgeUjq0cPM&amp;t=2s\">Singh</a></div>, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pi-Life-Hidden-Happiness-Mathematics/dp/1475833768/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494081693&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=pi+of+life\">Pi of Life</a>, not all problems require so much mastery. We may actually entertain our children’s curiosity with a very famous problem called Collatz Conjecture:</div><div>Sunil posted a snippet of a conversation with with his young daughter where she calculated the sequence:</div><div>7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.</div><div>This may seem a bit arbitrary, but let's make some sense of it. Notice that every even number is followed by half it’s value. For example 22 is followed by 11 and 20 is followed by 10. Also notice that the sequence ends in the number 1.</div><div>Perhaps pause now to see what else you can observe about this sequence. What do you see?</div><div>Observe for example that after every odd number there is an even number.</div><div>After 7 we get 22.</div><div>After 11 we get 34.</div><div>After 17 we get 52.</div><div>After 13 we get 40.</div><div>After 5 we get 16.</div><div>Can you suggest some relationship between an odd number and the number that follows it? How about multiply it by 3 and then add 1? For example, 3 * 7 + 1 = 22. Try it for the other odd numbers as well.Note that the order of operation matters here. First multiply by 3, and only after that add 1.</div><div>So this sequence of numbers acts as follows: You start with some number (in our example above 7), and then repeat the following step:</div><div>If the current number is even take half of it. If your current number is odd, triple it and add 1.</div><div>This sequence of numbers is sometimes called the hailstone sequence because the numbers in the sequence are subject to both ascents (when odd) and descents (when even). The analogy is to hailstones in a cloud. Apparently hailstones sometimes fly up and down inside a cloud. But do they all fall down? Or do some fly forever? </div><div>Returning from the hailstone analogy to an open problem in mathematics we have the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture\">Collatz Conjecture</a>:</div><div>Conjecture: For any starting value, a hailstone sequence eventually reaches the value 1.</div><div>In mathematics, a conjecture is a belief of something that is true, that has not yet been proven. Hence it may be that the conjecture is false. Proving that the conjecture is true or false is an open problem.</div><div>Researchers have tried to prove the Collatz Conjecture using a variety of methods and others have tried to disprove it by using computers and searching for huge numbers that end up in a cycle and never reach 1. But alas, all huge numbers tested reached one and to date, all proof attempts have failed. Indeed, it is an open problem.</div><div>So as Sunil did with his daughter I entertained my children with the hailstone sequence. To make things fun we played a little game. One of us chose a starting number and we took turns in saying out consecutive numbers in the sequence. The winner is the person that ends up with 1. For example, with three people, each marked with a different color you can get the following sequence:</div><div>6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.</div><div>Here the redperson decided to start with 6 and the green person won because she ended with 1. </div><div>We enjoyed playing a few rounds of this game. My daughters got the hang of the problem as we played and in the process had some arithmetic practice. It was common to want to start with 100 as the initial number. This yields 100, 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22,... and now we merged back with the sequence of Sunil's daughter. </div><div>Be careful for example with 27. Start with this value and your hailstone will fly high and take a long while until reaching the ground. How long? Maybe do it by hand, or work with your child using Excel for doing it (you may need to use &quot;if&quot; and &quot;mod&quot; or similar Excel functions).</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6a837123113840f0b6c4b88dbd32d1da~mv2_d_6024_5188_s_4_2.jpg\"/><div>Play around with your children for a while and see if they pose the famous open problem (Collatz conjecture) by themselfs: </div><div>Child: &quot;Do you always end up in 1?&quot;</div><div>Educator: &quot;Dear child, nobody knows yet. People have tried starting the sequence with many numbers and all numbers tested reached 1. But nobody proved that it is true for all numbers. Maybe you can become famous forever by finding an initial (huge) hailstone value, that never hits the ground. Or maybe you can investigate the Collatz conjecture a bit further and one day help find a proof. You never know.&quot;</div></div>\n"

For example, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;8&quot; and so fourth. What makes you choose those digits instead of others? </div><div>It isn't easy to understand how the brain works in this case. I certainly don't understand it. Nevertheless, we can explore some mathematics associated with sequences of digits that appear random, even though they are not.</div><div>For starters, look at the list of digits 0741852963. Do you recognize any pattern or rule? Most likely not.</div><div>But what you can do is notice that every decimal digit appears exactly once in 0741852963. When this occurs, such a list is called a permutation of the digits 0-9.</div><div>There are many possible permutations. Aren't there? Everyone knows the standard permutation 0123456789 in which the digits just increase one by one. Similarly, 9876543210 is easy to describe. But many permutations, like 0741852963, are more obscure.</div><div>Actually, how many permutations are there? This isn't the subject of this week's post, but we might as well have a quick look at it:</div><div>There are 3,628,800 possible permutations of the digits 0-9.</div><div>You can obtain this number using 10 factorial, written 10!. Yes, the exclamation mark reads “factorial” and means multiplying 10 by 9 by 8 by 7 all the way down to 1:</div><div>10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3,628,800.</div><div>Now here is a question: Are some of the permutations &quot;more random&quot; than others?</div><div>There isn't a definitive answer. If there was one, it would perhaps depend on how we measure randomness. If for example, we would just assume that every permutation is equally likely, then 0123456789 or 9876543210 are not more random than the 0741852963 that we started with.</div><div>Nevertheless, 0123456789 is less obscure than 0741852963<div>. Would you not agree? As you are reading this, I bet you that somewhere around the globe a child is counting 0123456789. But who is thinking about </div>0741852963 at the moment? Perhaps it is just you and the others reading this blog post?</div><div>There is an area of theoretical computer science that measures randomness of sequences based on how hard or easy it is to describe (or program) the sequence. This type of thing is sometimes called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity\">Kolmogorov Complexity</a> of the sequence. The ideas and theory of Kolmogorov Complexity are complex, so let's not go there fully. Instead, let's borrow the general principle: &quot;How to describe (or program) a sequence of digits&quot;?</div><div>Q: How would you describe 0123456789?</div><div>A: &quot;Write the digits 0-9 in an increasing order.&quot; Simple!</div><div>Q: Could you write a computer program that does that?</div><div>A: Yes. Without focusing on any specific computer programming language, let's maybe describe the procedure, program or algorithm like this:</div><div>1: set x to be 0</div><div>2: do lines 3 and 4, 10 times</div><div>3: print x</div><div>4: set x to be x+1</div><div>Not a programmer? No problem. Just treat lines 1,2,3 and 4 as commands to a computer. In line 1, a variable x is set to the value 0. Then lines 3 and 4 are circulated through 10 times. In line 3 the value of x is printed and in line 4 the value is incremented by one. Can you now see why this program prints 0123456789?</div><div>Q: When the program finishes, what is the value of x?</div><div>A:x = 10. However, that value is never printed.</div><div>Q: OK, so how would you write a program for the sequence 9876543210?</div><div>A: Maybe something like this?</div><div>1: set x to be 9</div><div>2: do lines 3 and 4, 10 times</div><div>3: print x</div><div>4: set x to be x-1</div><div>Do you see how it works? What is the value of x when this program finishes?</div><div>So lets get back to our special permutation 0741852963. How do we write a program to create this sequence?</div><div>For an arbitrary permutation of the digits, there typically isn't a simple program. But 0741852963 is not an arbitrary sequence. As I prepared this blog post, I created it usinga <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator\">linear congruential generator</a>. This is a classic, simple, yet robust manner for creating a sequence of numbers that appears random. Such a sequence is sometimes called pseudorandom.</div><div>Generation of (pseudo)random numbers has many applications including cryptography, video-games, statistics and general scientific computing. Being able to ask the computer to generate numbers that appear random is a great feature.</div><div>The linear congruential generator is typically applied for numbers much bigger than a single digit. Nevertheless, exploring how we use it to make an arbitrary (looking) permutation of 0-9, can be very instructive. Let's do that.</div><div>So here is the code for our specific sequence, 0741852963:</div><div>1: set x to be 0</div><div>2: do lines 3 and 4, 10 times</div><div>3: print x</div><div>4: set x to be (11*x + 7) mod 10</div><div>You may be impressed that the code is compact and looks very similar to the code for generating 0123456789. Almost exactly the same! What are the differences?</div><div>You now perhaps ask what is (11*x+7) mod 10? Here &quot;mod&quot; stands for modulo.</div><div>A number z mod 10 is the remainder obtained when dividing z by 10. You can also do mod 2, mod 45, or mod any number.</div><div>Q: What is 23 mod 10?</div><div>A:23 divided by 10 is 2 with a remainder of 3. So 23 mod 10 = 3.</div><div>Q: So isn’t any (whole) number mod 10, just the units digit of the original number?</div><div>A: Yes. Indeed when looking at numbers using base 10, mod 10 is special.</div><div>Just to see you are comfortable with modulo:</div><div>Q: What are the numbers z, such that z mod 2 = 0?</div><div>A: These are exactly the even numbers!</div><div>Q: So are the numbers z with z mod 2 = 1, exactly the odd numbers?</div><div>A: Yes!</div><div>OK, so you understand mod. Look now again at the line, (11*x+7) mod 10. This line takes x, multiplies by 11, adds 7 and then takes mod 10, keeping only the units digit. This may seem like some sort of black magic, but let's see how it works.</div><div>Write out what is happening in lines 3 and 4, repeating 10 times:</div><div>printing 0</div><div>x = (11*0 + 7) mod 10 = 7</div><div>printing 7</div><div>x = (11*7 + 7) mod 10 = 84 mod 10 = 4</div><div>printing 4</div><div>x = (11*4 + 7) mod 10 = 1</div><div>printing 1</div><div>x = (11*1 + 7) mod 10 = 8</div><div>printing 8</div><div>x = (11*8 + 7) mod 10 = 5</div><div>printing 5</div><div>x = (11*5 + 7) mod 10 = 2</div><div>printing 2</div><div>x = (11*2 + 7) mod 10 = 9</div><div>printing 9</div><div>x = (11*9+ 7) mod 10 = 6</div><div>printing 6</div><div>x = (11*6 + 7) mod 10 = 3</div><div>printing 3</div><div>x = (11*3 + 7) mod 10 = 0</div><div>At this point the program stops. Notice that the last execution, setting x to 0, did not affect the output.</div><div>Q: If we ran the loop (on lines 3, 4) one more time what would it do?</div><div>A: Since x is again 0 (where it started), it would repeat as before and print 0. And if we continued to run for a whole ten steps, the whole sequence 0741852963 would be printed again.</div><div>There is so much more to say about the linear congruential generator, and there are many options for playing with it as well. For example, you may try to change the constants 11 and 7 in line 4 to other constants. After you do that, experiment to see what happens.</div><div>You'll see that some constants are &quot;good&quot; in the sense that they create a full permutation of 0-9, while others are &quot;less good&quot; as they yield much smaller cycles of digits. </div><div>You can also do mod 100, or mod 1000, or mod any number that you wish. In fact, many computer software packages use the linear congruential generator with mod 2^32 - 1, or mod2^64 - 1. These are the biggest possible integers on 32 bit or 64 bit computers.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_cff2aa0a4807476d9ce80c8afe037221~mv2.jpg\"/><div>We'll leave understanding the theory associated with the linear congruential generator for another day. But if you want to drive curiosity and nurture connections with your students or loved ones, then you can experiment with it and have fun.</div><div>Here for example is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtEivGPxwAI\">video of a very engaging activity</a> that I found on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq0EGvLTyy-LLT1oUSO_0FQ\">WooTube</a>. Perhaps you can reproduce such an activity with your students or loved ones. See the Excel based examples that <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/misterwootube\">Eddie Woo</a> explores in the second half of the video. Can you reproduce such an Excel spreadsheet? Try it. Challenge your children to do the same. Better yet, nurture your connection and drive their curiosity by doing it together.</div></div>\n"

Perhaps even multiple triangles if you look hard enough. </div><div>But hold on. Even though triangles are simple to describe and easy to spot, there are many facts about triangles that are not immediately obvious. For starters, what is a nice way to cut a triangle into smaller pieces?</div><div>Imagine for example a triangular cake. Something that looks like this:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_27e76dcc64f742b3af7755db17ba18d1~mv2.png\"/><div>How would you divide such a cake evenly, between, say, 6 people?</div><div>For the usual round cake this is pretty straightforward. It is enough to make 3 straight cuts through the center of the cake that divide it into 6 sectors with equal angles (each of 60 degrees):</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_1c6a461254664414940cf677a3116209~mv2.png\"/><div>What if we ask the same question about our triangular cake? You may answer:</div><div>&quot;Just like for a circle, make 3 straight cuts through the center.&quot;</div><div>But where is the center of a triangle? Does it even have a “center”?</div><div>Fortunately, Euclidean geometry comes to help. It is a beautiful mathematical system described in Euclid’s book “Elements” as early as 300 BC. Based on axioms and formal proofs, it set the standard of mathematics being a rigorous systematic science rather than a collection of disconnected facts.</div><div>For the moment, let us assume that we live on a plane, so our world and, in particular, all our cakes are 2 dimensional. Alternatively, we can just imagine that we look at them from the top, like in the pictures above.</div><div>First of all, let us recall some basic facts about lines on a plane. Any two lines either intersect or they are parallel:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_237c855ad757411eb98ccd55628fa37c~mv2.png\"/><div>Now, 3 lines on a plane generally don’t intersect in one point:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_3f3c1fb8f85a40719ef43451d91ab283~mv2.png\"/><div>But it turns out that certain lines associated with any triangle always intersect in one point! Here we consider one such threesome of lines, called medians. A median is a line connecting a vertex of the triangle with the midpoint of the opposite side.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_666ab8f0934e4425b56c4fc9653939ba~mv2.png\"/><div>As you can see in the picture above, the vertices of the triangle are marked with A, B and C. Then we construct the midpoints D, E and F and connect each of these with the corresponding opposite vertex of the triangle, to obtain the medians AD, BE and CF.</div><div>As the figure shows, our triangle is now divided into 6 smaller triangles. What about their area? You probably recall that the area of a triangle equals 1/2 of the base times height:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_e262064f4a724db4844f3aed4de59df1~mv2.png\"/><div>In particular, this implies that</div><div>A median cuts a triangle into two pieces of the same area. </div><div>Can you draw a few illustrations of triangles that show this? Notice that depending on your triangle and your choice of vertex from which to draw the median, the two pieces may look different. But they always have the same size. This is guaranteed because they have the same height and equal bases.</div><div>So now you know how to divide a triangular cake between 2 people. But if you divide it between 6 people, is the area of all the 6 pieces the same? Actually, does the point G in the figure above even exist? Will the three cuts intersect in one point?</div><div>Now here is an incredible fact. And in mathematics, if a fact is incredible enough, or non trivial enough, or important enough, it is called a &quot;Theorem&quot;.</div><div>Theorem: The 3 medians of any triangle intersect in one point, G, called the centroid. Furthermore, the medians divide the triangle into 6 triangles of the same area.</div><div>A theorem is quite a serious thing for mathematicians. You can't just write it down. It requires a proof. Otherwise it is just a belief, a conjecture or a statement that may be considered true by some and false by others. Having a correct proof, ensures that it is true. Nevertheless, if you believe it already and need to urgently split your triangular cake among 6, follow this:</div><div>To divide any triangular cake fairly among 6 people, make 3 cuts. Each cut going from a vertex to the center of the opposite side. The theorem above guarantees that the cuts will intersect at a single point. Further, even though the six pieces may not have the same shape, they will all have the same size. </div><div>To get a better feel for the medians and the centroid, you can also explore this neat interactive <a href=\"http://mathifold.org/en/applet_centroid.html\">Mathifold visualization</a>. The Mathifold project features a growing collection of visualizations that help illustrate both simple and complex mathematical concepts and phenomena. In the visualization, you can see that no matter how we deform the triangle, the medians always intersect in one point. </div><div>So you saw the theorem about cutting cakes. Are you ready for the proof?</div><div>Proof. Construct the medians BE and CF. Denote the point of their intersection by G. We want to show that the line through A and G bisects CB. Denote the point of intersection by D.</div><div>Note now that our triangle is divided into 6 smaller triangles. Denote the areas of these triangles by</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_bd8c1e6578964eefaa290b1a62e3960a~mv2.png\"/><div>as follows: </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_2ee1d7c550254ffe85845ae504952213~mv2.png\"/><div>Note that GE is a median of AGC and GF is a median of AGB. Thus, we obtain:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_663bbc2b5443403f8bc0cb9229e85263~mv2.png\"/><div>The median BE divides ABC into two triangles (CBE and ABE) of the same area. Thus,</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_010c440b413d4bc3acde2b18963b95dc~mv2.png\"/><div>Analogously, looking at the median CF we see that</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_ba5b1c66f0534abca1f65efde7e007e5~mv2.png\"/><div>These equations yield: </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_4d9a63f2f6d34ca3920366e7f9018a5d~mv2.png\"/><div>In particular, this implies that the 4 areas</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_cdfd905bd6cc4f748b40b2fe68859fd2~mv2.png\"/><div>are the same. Denote it by S.</div><div>Now using the formula for the area of a triangle, observe that for any line connecting a vertex of the triangle with a point on the opposite side, the ratio of the areas of the resulting triangles is the same as the ratio of the bases:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_18d3ee63d7fb4c31ba5457b9b40684dc~mv2.png\"/><div>Now, comparing the areas of CAD and BAD we have</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_4a950f87597b4b628fcfc8a1a830da1f~mv2.png\"/><div>Analogously, comparing the areas of CGD and BGD, we see that</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_5ce91b2a37ed4c1b9387a19bcfe16aed~mv2.png\"/><div>From the last two equations we obtain</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_5f4e37f54d0b464fa74c1416f056f481~mv2.png\"/><div>This implies that</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_4c5ee76b67bd468082e10d48af730914~mv2.png\"/><div>and using the equations above, also implies that these two areas equal the rest. Hence all six pieces have the same area. Also using the ratio above, CD=DB, so AD is a median as needed. </div><div>Q.E.D.</div><div>The &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase &quot;quod erat demonstrandum&quot;, or translated to English: &quot;that which was to be demonstrated&quot;. You speak Latin, don't you? It is common practice to finish mathematical proofs with Q.E.D.</div><div>Now, let’s come back to our earlier question “Where is the center of a triangle?” We answered this with the centroid, but it turns out that, unlike circles, triangles have at least 4 possible centers!</div><div>Apart from the centroid, other common centers are the incenter, circumcenter and orthocenter, all of which were known to the Ancient Greeks. If you aren't familiar with these, can you try and guess how they would be defined? We may discuss these in future blog posts.</div><div>So now we are ready to deal with triangular cakes and we can dream on about other geometric shapes like quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons and so on. Such objects are called polygons. And one day we may even dare to move up a dimension and produce some 3D culinary creations. Perhaps something like this:</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_a3763fb4d8824f298abeb3f07ba38b1f~mv2.png\"/></div>\n"

There are 20 questions, each one with four possible answers (a), (b), (c) or (d), one of which is correct. You are feeling lucky and hence don't read the questions. Instead you are guessing random answers. How bad can that be?</div><div>Frankly, years ago at high school, this was my typical mode of operation. I wasn't too keen on studies, could not concentrate and often felt frustrated at exams. So I thought that by guessing, I will end up doing not so bad. After all, the goddess of chance may make it possible to get all answers correct.</div><div>Only years later, I realized that the chance of actually passing such an exam, by getting a result of 11/20 or better, is very low. Theoretically it actually stands at about 0.00394. That means that only about one out of 254 exams is going to be a passing exam. Hence by guessing, I was actually almost guaranteed to fail. In fact, it is practically impossible to guess all answers correctly.</div><div>Let's understand this a bit better.</div><div>Q: What is the chance of guessing the answer for a single question correctly?</div><div>A: There are four options for each question, so the chance is 1/4 = 0.25.</div><div>Q: So on average, how many questions can I expect to get correctly in the whole exam?</div><div>A: There are 20 questions, and on average 1/4 of the questions will be answered correctly. So on average, the number of correct answers is 1/4 of 20. That is 5.</div><div>Q: But surely it is possible to get more than 5 questions correct. For example, what is the chance of getting all 20 correct?</div><div>A: Here getting all 20 correct requires success in the first question, the second question, the third,... all the way up to the last question. The chance of each such success is 1/4. Since our guesses don't affect each other, the chance for success in all 20 is</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_145ae941068e4e90a301e372e8386623~mv2.png\"/><div>As you may imagine, this is actually an incredibly small number. It equals about 10^(-12) or 0.000000000001.</div><div>To help you interpret such a low probability, try and guess the answer to this question:</div><div>If you were filling out a random exam solution every 30 seconds and having it automatically checked, what is the expected (average) time until you fill out a perfect exam?</div><div>Answer options (select one):</div><div>(a) 60 seconds.</div><div>(b) 20 years.</div><div>(c) 250 years.</div><div>(d) One million years.</div><div>Did you try and make an educated guess for the correct answer?</div><div>Solution: Say you can fill out an exam in 30 seconds. So in a sleepless day, you can fill out 2 x 60 x 24 = 2,880 exams. Then multiplying by 365, in a year you can fill out 1,051,200 exams. This is about a million exams a year. Sounds fun! Now the number of exams you need to do on average until filling one out with all questions correct is 10^12 (a trillion). This means you'll need to work for about 10^12/10^6 = 10^6 years, or about a million years until acing your first exam.</div><div>Of course you may be lucky and ace an exam before a million years pass. But don't forget that we didn't take sleep into consideration, so at the minimum you'll need quite a few coffee breaks and those will slow you down. Alternatively with some study and if you choose to read the questions and make more educated guesses, you may increase the chance of success in each question from 1/4 to 1/2, 0.8, 0.9 or even 0.99.</div><div>Perhaps try to repeat the calculation for a chance of success per question of 0.9. In that case, what is the chance of succeeding in all questions?</div><div>Back to guessing? Here are more facts about the exam.</div><div>Q: Is the chance of getting all answers wrong the same as the chance of getting all answers correct?</div><div>A: Here similar reasoning shows that failing at all 20 questions happens with a chance of (3/4)^20. This is also a small number, but certainly not as small as (1/4)^20. It stands at about 0.00317. On a positive note this means that there is a chance of 1 - 0.00317= 0.99683 (almost certain) of getting at least one question correct. </div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_b59506589ad948928229dc9a254b2dfb~mv2.jpg\"/><div>Perhaps take a moment for this fact:</div><div>The chance of failing at all 20 questions (317 out of 10,000) is very similar to the chance of passing the exam with 11 or more correct answers (394 out of 10,000). </div><div>Q: So how do you calculate the chance of passing (getting 11 or more correct answers out of 20)? </div><div>A: This is actually not as simple as the other calculations we carried out. It isn't overly complicated, but requires using something called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution\">Binomial Distribution</a>.</div><div>As a start, you can visit this <a href=\"http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/binomial.aspx\">Binomial Calculator on Stat Trek</a>. On that page, key in 0.25 for &quot;Probability of success in a single trial&quot;, 20 for &quot;Number of trials&quot; and 11 for &quot;Number of successes&quot;. You'll then see resulting probabilities associated with our exact problem. Do you spot the chance of passing the exam, 0.00394?</div><div>We'll discuss the details of this binomial calculation in a future blog post. In the meantime, if anyone around you is studying for an exam, nurture your connection with them by helping them enjoy the learning process.</div><div>It is actually important to remember that grades are not all that matters. The knowledge acquisition process is often much more important. Maybe ask the goddess of chance, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna\">Fortuna</a>, what she thinks.</div></div>\n"

If you are willing to ignore the tiny effects that the theory of relativity has on human ageing, then you would agree that both you and your child grow at the same rate. When a year passes for your child, a year passes for you as well.</div><div>But here is a related question:</div><div>Will your child's age at any given time be half of your age at that time? If so, then when?</div><div>Let's take one of my daughters as an example. She is now 8 and I'm 43. There are 35 years between us. Indeed, she was born when I was 35 years old. Will she ever be half my age?</div><div>When she was 1 year old, I was 36. She was 1/36 of my age (0.0277 of my age). When she was 5 years old, I was 40. That is 1/8 of my age (0.125 of my age). Now at 8 and me at 43 she is 0.186 of my age. When I'm 50, she will be 15. That is 0.3 of my age.</div><div>Is she closing in on me? As you clearly see, we'll always have 35 years between us. But as we both grow older, the gap of 35 years becomes less significant. What if I am still alive at 100? She will be 65 at the time. That is 0.65 of my age. And just for the fun of it, what if we were immortal; how do my daughter and me compare when I'm 1000? She is then 0.965 of my age. Very close to me in relative terms.</div><div>Back to the original question:</div><div>When is my daughter going to be half my age?</div><div>This is by no means a deep mathematical question. Nevertheless, it can be very rewarding to discuss with your children. Speaking about it doesn't only bring mathematical thought, it can also stimulate discussion about childhood vs. adulthood, years, times, plans, aspirations and pretty much anything else.</div><div>On the basic mathematical front, it can be fun to explore in various ways: </div><div><div>With young children, it is a way to explore basic arithmetic together with trial and error calculations.</div><div>With slightly older children, you can write an equation and use it to find a solution with basic Algebra.</div>Finally, this question has a neat simple answer that doesn't require any calculation. Frankly, I wasn't aware of it until I sat down to write this blog post. For me it was a sweet little discovery. Maybe you want to give it a bit more thought to see if you can work it out yourself, before you read on...</div><div>Q and A with my 8 year old daughter...</div><div>Q: What is our age difference?A: You daddy are 43, I am 8... (thinking), so 35.Q: How old was I when you were born? </div><div>A: 35! (Looking at me with a &quot;Duh Daddy!&quot; look).</div><div>Q: How old will I be when you are 30?</div><div>A:30+35 = 65, so you will be 65.</div><div>Q: Is that double your age at that time?</div><div>A: No. 2 x 30 = 60 &lt; 65.</div><div>Q: How about when you are 31?</div><div>A:66. But that is still not double because 2 x 31 = 62 &lt; 66.</div><div>Q: How about when you are 32?</div><div>A:67. It still not double (64 &lt; 67).</div><div>Q: So when will you be half my age (or me double your age)?</div><div>A: (Thinking...) When I'm 33, you are 68. When I'm 34, you are 69..... Ahhh, I got it! When I'm 35, you are 70.</div><div>Quite magical actually, the thought of her being 35 and me 70. I hope that she'll still have patience for my mathematical exploration by that time. If not, maybe I'll have to try the grandchildren.</div><div>So is there a systematic way to find the solution? One straightforward way is to use basic equations. Let the variable C denote the age of the child and let P denote the age of the parent. Here both variables are measuring the ages in that special year where the child's age is half that of the parent. How can we express this with C and P? Mathematical expression of this type isn't hard actually. Just write,</div><div>2 x C = P.</div><div>But we also know that there is a fixed age difference between C and P. For example for my daughter and me as mentioned above, </div><div>C + 35 = P.</div><div>So now we are seeking the ages C and P that satisfy both of these equations. Does it make sense? Satisfying the first equation means that the parent's age is twice the child's age (or child is half the parent). Satisfying the second equation means that the parent had the child at age 35. There is always a difference of 35 years between them.</div><img src=\"http://static.wixstatic.com/media/751ee7_6a837123113840f0b6c4b88dbd32d1da~mv2_d_6024_5188_s_4_2.jpg\"/><div>There are many ways of solving such (linear) equations. One way is to observe that the right hand side of both equations is P and thus equate the left hand sides of both equations. You see, the equal sign (=) in mathematics is incredible. It means that anything on the left hand side of it can replace anything on the right hand side and vice versa. Also, if X=Y and Y=Z, then guess what it says about X and Z?</div><div>We now get,</div><div>2 x C = C + 35.</div><div>This is now a single equation for the unknown variable C. We can now subtract C from both sides of the equation and this gives:</div><div>C = 35.</div><div>So you see, with algebra we can get the same answer we got with trial and error above. When the child (C) will be 35, the parent (P) will be twice the age.</div><div>But wait a minute! You may be looking at the algebra above and seeing that we didn't really do anything with the number 35. The algebra we did, works with any age difference.</div><div>Take my parents and me as an example. My mom and dad had me when they were both 22. Replace 35 with 22in the above equations and what do you get? Here I'm enjoying the prospect of being &quot;C&quot; instead of &quot;P&quot; for this example. Don't get me wrong, parenting is great. But being a child is even better, even if momentarily. </div><div>The algebra we did above for 35 works now for 22 in the exact same manner. We then get C = 22 (and P=44). By the way, at 43 and with parents at 65, I'm 0.66 of their age. I'm closing in!</div><div>Try this with your children. At what age did you have your child? At what age is she or he going to be half of your age?</div><div>Here is the rule we discovered: </div><div>Your child will be half your age when they reach the age you were on their birth.</div><div>Why is that? The algebra shows it, but are there other explanations? Well, think about it. It took me a bit of time to figure it out:</div><div>When your child reaches the age that was your age during their birth, then for every day that she lived till that age, you lived exactly two days!</div><div>The first half of those days were perhaps nice. But the second half is incredible! Can your child explain why?</div></div>\n"
